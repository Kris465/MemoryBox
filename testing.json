His head was slightly lowered as he spoke to the woman with a gentle expression on his face while the woman leaned into his arms with a faint smile on her face.\nThe man in the photo was Lin Xiaowan\u2019s husband, but she was not familiar with the woman. Although she was not familiar with the other woman, this was not the first time she had seen the woman. After all, she had been receiving photo after photo of this woman with her husband, and the photos, which stung her eyes, were accompanied by provocative messages with a smug undertone.\nLin Xiaowan had recognized the woman the first time she had received the photo. The woman was the ex-lover of Huo Zheng, her husband, and that woman was someone her husband could not forget.\nLin Xiaowan switched her phone off and acted like nothing happened.\n\u2026\nWhen Huo Zheng finally came home, it was already late at night. It was winter so the temperature was very low, especially when it was late at night. He stood at the door and rubbed his hands together to keep warm after he removed his coat. After he felt a little warmer, he looked at Lin Xiaowan, who had fallen asleep on the couch, before he slowly walked over and bent down to carefully pick her up.\nAs soon as Huo Zheng picked Lin Xiaowan up, she woke up. Although he had already removed his coat, she could still smell an unfamiliar and subtle fragrance on him. She felt a sting in her heart, but she did not say anything. Instead, she raised her arms and wound them around his neck before she pressed herself closer to him in a very dependent manner. Then, she asked softly, \u201cWhy did you come back so late? Have you eaten dinner?\u201d\nHuo Zheng lowered his head and gently kissed her forehead before he replied, \u201cI\u2019ve already eaten. Don\u2019t wait for me and fall asleep on the couch next time. It\u2019s so cold now, and it\u2019s easy for you to catch a cold.\u201d\nHuo Zheng was very strong. He walked steadily as he carried his wife upstairs to the bedroom.\nLin Xiaowan enjoyed the chance to snuggle in his arms. She said in a coquettish manner, \u201cThen, come back earlier next time. I\u2019ll wait for you no matter what.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll be less busy in a few days. At that time, I\u2019ll accompany you.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan lowered her gaze and asked, \u201cCan we go to the North Pole? I want to relax and see the northern lights.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlright.\u201d\nHuo Zheng placed Lin Xiaowan on the bed and carefully covered her with the blanket. Then, he lay next to her and patted her gently, coaxing her to sleep, as he said, \u201cIn two days, I have something to tell you.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan panicked upon hearing this. She turned to the side and hugged his waist before she said, \u201cDon\u2019t forget about the day after tomorrow. I want two gifts!\u201d\nLin Xiaowan\u2019s birthday was the day after tomorrow. It was also their third wedding anniversary. She was afraid of what Huo Zheng wanted to tell her so she quickly said, \u201cCan you tell me after my birthday?\u201d\nHuo Zheng lowered his head again to kiss her before he said, \u201cAlright. Don\u2019t talk anymore. Sleep.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan yawned and rubbed her face against Huo Zheng\u2019s expensive suit as she said, \u201cOne more thing. The gift I prepared for you this year is really amazing. You definitely won\u2019t be able to guess what it is.\u201d\nHuo Zheng did not say anything. He only looked at the woman in his arms gently. After she fell asleep, he got out of bed as gently as possible, afraid of waking her up, before he went to wash up and change his clothes. After that, he went to his study to deal with some unfinished work. Earlier, it had gotten quite late, and he was worried that Lin Xiaowan would be waiting for him at home so he rushed back.\n\u2026\nThe next evening, Huo Zheng still did not return for dinner. Similarly, Lin Xiaowan received new photos.\nOne showed Huo Zheng protecting the woman carefully as she got out of the car while the other showed Huo Zheng and the woman walking hand in hand to a jewelry store.\nLin Xiaowan stared at her phone for a moment. After she finally made up her mind, she put on her clothes and went out. She decided to go to the address that was sent along with the photos.\n\u2026\nLin Xiaowan stood in the distance, but thanks to the glass door, she could easily see what was going on inside the store.\nThere were a few people in the store. One of them was Huo Zheng. He was picking out a ring with the woman. The woman stretched out her hand to him as she chatted happily. He held her hand and helped her put the ring on.\n\nNo matter how many photos Lin Xiaowan had seen, they were not as impactful as witnessing it with her own eyes.\nAt this moment, Lin Xiaowan felt her heart sink. She stood there in a daze; her mind was empty, but her heart was eerily calm. After a while, she brought her phone out and sent a message to Huo Zheng. The winter chill caused her fingers to tremble as she typed the message, resulting in quite a few misspelled words.\n[Lin Xiaowan: Are you coming back for dinner today?]\nLin Xiaowan\u2019s phone rang, and she received a reply almost immediately.\n[Huo Zheng: I have work to do. Sleep early. Don\u2019t wait up for me.]\nLin Xiaowan pursed her lips. Her eyes turned red immediately as tears fell. At this time, she finally knew the reason for Huo Zheng\u2019s long hours at work and overtime, and she also found the owner of the unfamiliar scent she smelled on him.\nLin Xiaowan had long known about Huo Zheng\u2019s first love. She had found out when they had just gotten married. At that time, she was bored so she went to Huo Zheng\u2019s study and found a book to read. When she flipped the book open, a photo of a girl fell out of the book. There was a love letter written by Huo Zheng to his first love along with the photo.\nLin Xiaowan did not know when the letter was written, but she could feel his love, tenderness, and sincerity in the words. At that time, she felt her heart turn cold. Huo Zheng had never said such touching words to her before.\nIn fact, Lin Xiaowan\u2019s meeting and marriage with Huo Zheng were very sudden. She still did not know why he married her. He had never told her that he liked her, let alone loved her. Nonetheless, he treated her very well. They had been together for almost four years now, and they had never quarreled before. He would also celebrate Valentine\u2019s Day, birthdays, and all kinds of anniversaries with her. However, the downside was that she spent a lot of time waiting for him. Although he treated her well, he was extremely busy. He rarely spent a lot of time with her. As such, she spent most of her time waiting for him\u2026 only to be confronted with such a result today.\nLin Xiaowan could not hold back her tears at all; her heart was in turmoil. She cried as she walked, wiping her tears away as they fell. By the time she stood at the intersection to wait for the traffic light to change, her sleeves were already wet with tears. She was aware of the sorry state she was in at this moment, but she really could not control her emotions and her tears. She rarely cried, and now that she was crying, she was doing it in public.\nAt this time, a little girl carrying a school bag stuffed a packet of tissue into Lin Xiaowan\u2019s hand and kindly comforted Lin Xiaowan. She said, \u201cDon\u2019t be sad. No matter what happens, things will get better.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan shook her head and thanked the little girl.\nThe little girl smiled at Lin Xiaowan before she quickly ran to the other side seeing that the light had turned green.\nAfter a few moments, Lin Xiaowan walked forward in a daze when she heard someone shouting, \u201cMove!\u201d\nLin Xiaowan instinctively stopped in her tracks and looked up blankly. The light had changed. Following that, her vision blurred, and she felt pain all over her body.\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

Just the act of coughing alone seemed to drain her strength. She struggled to open her eyes before she saw the winter sky and the bare branches of the trees that seemed to be stretching out toward her like arms, and she heard the cacophonous sounds of people screaming and cars honking around her. Her mind was blank at this moment as she shivered from the cold.\nLin Xiaowen\u2019s tears fell again. She did not even know she had so many tears to cry. It was as though she was making up for more than 20 years of not crying at this time. When she finally calmed down a little, she thought that she must look terrible now. She was a woman who loved beauty, after all. She tried to lift her hand to wipe her face but discovered that she could not move her arm at all.\nEvery part of her body hurt. Huo Zheng had taken very good care of her over the past few years, and she had grown even more delicate because of his care. Even when she had gotten a small cut on her finger, he would hold her in his arms and coax her for a long time.\nAlas, now that she was in so much pain, Huo Zheng was not around to hold her in his arms. He would never hold her in his arms again.\nLin Xiaowan\u2019s strength gradually drained out of her body as she gradually lost consciousness. The moment she closed her eyes, she had the illusion that someone was hugging her tightly. However, she could not smell the unpleasant and unfamiliar scent.\nAt the final moment before Lin Xiaowan died, she did not feel pain, only heart-wrenching sadness. Her last thought was that if she had known beforehand, she would not have gotten married.\n\u2026\nLin Xiaowan opened her eyes.\nThe window was half open, and the breeze blew the white curtains up. Faint golden sunlight shone against the wall.\nLin Xiaowan lay on the bed in a daze for a long time. She remembered that she seemed to have died. She could still remember the excruciating pain, the exhaustion, the confusion, and the sense of powerlessness.\nAfter a moment, she raised her arm and looked at her fair hand in front of her before she relaxed.\n\u2018What\u2019s going on?\u2019\n\u2026\nWhen Huo Zheng entered the room, he saw Lin Xiaowan sitting by the bay window and looking out the window in a daze. He walked over and hugged her.\nLin Xiaowan was shocked and instinctively shrank away from his arms like a frightened rabbit as she looked up at him with her big eyes.\nHuo Zheng did not think much of it. He assumed she had just woken up and was still in a daze. He kissed her forehead naturally and said, \u201cAunty said that you slept for a long time in the afternoon.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan did not want to get close to him, but her body seemed to have a mind of its own as she leaned closer to him.\nHuo Zheng hugged her and brought her to the dining room.\n\nEven after dinner, Lin Xiaowan was still in a daze.\nAt night, Huo Zhen held Lin Xiaowan in his arms as he read an Italian book to her.\nLin Xiaowan felt sleepy as she listened to him read. When she finally yawned, Huo Zheng bookmarked the book and put it away. He lowered his head and planted a kiss on her forehead, the tip of her nose, and her soft lips. He pressed his lips against her gently and did not move, silently asking for her permission. If she refused, he would not force her. He was a gentleman, and even in bed, he was polite and restrained.\nLin Xiaowan moved her lips lightly as though she was acquiescing to him. She hugged him, feeling his strong back, as she raised her swan-like neck and pressed herself closer to him.\nWhen tears rolled down the corners of her eyes, he gently kissed them away. He hugged her and said tenderly in a hoarse voice, \u201cDon\u2019t cry.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan really wished she could stop her tears. However, her empty heart seemed to cause her tears to flow uncontrollably.\nHuo Zheng felt slightly helpless. He stopped and tried to pull away to see what was wrong, but she refused to let him go. Tears continued to fall as she moved closer to him and kissed him. She tormented him until he had no choice but to give in.\n\u2026\nWhen they were done, Huo Zheng carried Lin Xiaowan into the shower. When they came out, he helped her to dry her hair.\nWhen Lin Xiaowan finally lay on the bed, she moved to the corner and did not talk. She could feel Huo Zheng staring at her back for a few moments before he finally walked away.\nWhen she was just about to fall asleep, she felt herself being pulled into a firm embrace.\nHuo Zheng kissed her shoulder and held her hand that was gripping the blanket. Then, he slid a plain ring onto her ring finger.\nLin Xiaowan opened her eyes. She watched as Huo Zheng held her hand and kissed her finger.\n\u201cIt fits just right\u2026\u201d\n\u2018It\u2019s different from the previous life,\u2019 Lin Xiaowan thought to herself as memories of the past returned to her.\nIn her previous life, Huo Zheng had given her the ring in the morning. They had been fooling around in the morning when he suddenly pulled out a ring from seemingly nowhere before putting it on her finger.\nAt that time, Lin Xiaowan had been very surprised. She held his hands and asked, \u201cAre you proposing to me?\u201d\n\u201cAre you going to say yes?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\nThe two of them did not waste time after that and quickly registered their marriage.\nLin Xiaowan was the only person left in her family. She did not say anything, and Huo Zheng did not ask any questions.\nWhen Lin Xiaowan\u2019s mind returned to the present, she saw Huo Zheneg looking at her with bright eyes, as though he was waiting for her to say something. She asked hoarsely, \u201cWhy did you suddenly buy a ring?\u201d\nHuo Zheng rested his forehead against hers and asked, \u201cWill you marry me?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan had no parents, no dowry, and no friends. She only had herself to rely on in her life. In her previous life, she had made a mistake.\nHuo Zheng continued to look at her tenderly.\nLin Xiaowan suddenly turned around and hugged Huo Zheng tightly before she kissed him. She was very grateful to him during the three years they were together. Those three years were the most stable and carefree years of her life, but she really did not want to make the same mistake.\n\u2026\nEarly the next morning, Lin Xiaowan was still deep in her sleep. She had fallen asleep after midnight the night before, after all. When she finally opened her eyes groggily, Huo Zheng was already awake. She instinctively reached out for a hug. It was a hidden habit from her previous life.\nHuo Zheng leaned over and hugged her. He was originally standing by the bed, and this position was awkward and tiring. He patted her gently as though he was coaxing a child.\nLin Xiaowan pouted as she asked in a soft and sleepy voice, \u201cWhy are you up so early?\u201d\nHuo Zheng tried his best to sound gentle as he replied, \u201cI have to go on a business trip. Let\u2019s get married when I return.\u201d\nHuo Zheng waited for a long time for Lin Xiaowan\u2019s reply after he finished speaking. When he looked down at her, he smiled faintly when he saw that she had already fallen asleep again.\n\u2026\nWhen Lin Xiaowan finally woke up, the sun was already high in the clear blue sky.\nIt was summer now. The birds and cicadas outside were calling out with all their might.\nAfter she ate, she entered the study. She walked over to the bookshelf immediately and easily found the book she was looking for.\nShe looked at the title of the book, The Theory of Money. She remembered the title very clearly. After all, this was the book where the photo and love letter were hidden.\nLin Xiaowan felt slightly nervous and did not open the book immediately after taking it out. After mentally preparing herself for a long time, she finally flipped open the book. She planned to bring the photo and love letter to Huo Zheng and ask him about them after he returned from his business trip.\nTo Lin Xiaowan\u2019s surprise, there was nothing hidden in the book. There was no photo or love letter.\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly. Thank you so much!\n\n", "3": "https://novellive.com/book/becoming-a-wealthy-familys-beloved-after-her-rebirth/chapter-3\n\nLin Xiaowan was stunned, staring blankly at the book. After a while, she recalled that Huo Zheng and her were not married yet. Perhaps, for this reason, there was nothing hidden in the book yet.\nThere was no way for Lin Xiaowan to comfort herself at all. If there was a letter now, it could mean that Huo Zheng had written the letter before he knew her or before they got together, after all. However, it was different if the letter was written after their marriage.\nLin Xiaowan did not give up. She flipped through the pages of the book to find the photo and the love letter. However, there was nothing.\nShe began to question herself.\n\u2018Maybe I wasn\u2019t reborn\u2026 Could it be that I had a long dream yesterday? Perhaps, those three years are just a dream?\u2019\nHowever, Lin Xiaowan was not convinced. After all, the pain, the difficulty she had breathing, and the moments before her death were too real. How could a dream be so real?\nShe had her fair share of vivid dreams before, and they were never so vivid. For example, she once dreamed that she was reading the newspaper in bed with her father in their old house. She was snuggled up in her father\u2019s arms and read the newspaper seriously. Halfway through, she even remembered getting out of bed to get corn candy.\nWhen she finally woke up, she was in a daze for a long time, unable to extricate herself from the dream. She even remembered the news she read. However, when she rushed out of her room, she discovered there was no corn candy.\nDreams and reality were the opposite of each other. In the dream, she had all of her father\u2019s love for a short time. However, she had nothing outside of the dream.\nWhen Lin Xiaowan regained her senses, she carefully searched the other books on the bookshelf. However, she still did not find anything.\n\u2026\nWhenever Huo Zheng went on business trips, he would video call Lin Xiaowan every night before she went to bed. He would tell her about his day, his work, where he went, and who he had seen. It gave her a sense of security.\nIt was the same this time, but after Huo Zheng finished speaking, he finally realized that Lin Xiaowan, who had been silent for a long time, was distracted. He frowned slightly. After all, she had always listened to him attentively in the past.\nLin Xiaowan did not even realize Huo Zheng had finished speaking until he called out, \u201cQingqing.\u201d\nQingqing was the name Lin Xiaowan had given herself. When she met Huo Zheng in the past, she had introduced herself as Lin Qingqing. Later, when he found out that her real name was Lin Xiaowan, he continued to call her \u2018Qingqing\u2019.\nLin Xiaowan snapped back to her senses and saw the frown on Huo Zheng\u2019s face. She asked, \u201cWhat? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d\nShe smiled sheepishly and added, \u201cYou\u2019re done talking?\u201d\n\u201cYou weren\u2019t listening,\u201d Huo Zheng said.\nLin Xiaowan laughed, pretending like nothing was wrong.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Huo Zheng asked.\nIn fact, Lin Xiaowan was trying to recall the name of Huo Zheng\u2019s first love.\n\u2018Is Lin Zhiyi or Song Zhiyi? Or is it another name? However, I remember seeing this name before\u2026\u2019\nFor a moment, Lin Xiaowan was overcome by the urge to ask Huo Zheng about his first love. However, the words were stuck in her throat. After a long time, she only said, \u201cI had a dream. I dreamed that you didn\u2019t want me anymore.\u201d\nHer voice grew softer and softer as she spoke, and a hint of hesitance could be heard in her voice as she said, \u201cThen\u2026 I died\u2026\u201d\nHuo Zheng\u2019s expression darkened almost immediately. He said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk nonsense.\u201d\nHis tone was a little stern, which was rare.\n\u201cWhy are you fierce? I already said it was a dream,\u201d Lin Xiaowan said.\nHuo Zheng\u2019s expression was still a little dark.\n\u201cDreams and reality are the opposite. You won\u2019t abandon me, right?\u201d Lin Xiaowan asked.\nHuo Zheng\u2019s expression eased slightly upon hearing these words. He said, \u201cYou\u2019re not going to die.\u201d\nThat seemed to be the main point for him.\nLin Xiaowan nodded like a chick pecking at grains on the ground as she said with a sweet smile, \u201cYes, yes, I won\u2019t die.\u201d\nAfter the call ended, Huo Zheng still felt a little uneasy. It took a while before he finally got back to his work.\nOn the other hand, Lin Xiaowan went on the Internet and searched a few names. However, there was no useful information, and the names had connections with Huo Zheng.\n\u2026\nThe day before Huo Zheng returned, Lin Xiaowan received a call from an unknown number. Initially, she did not plan to answer the calls. She usually did not answer calls from unknown numbers. However, she found the string of numbers familiar so she answered the call.\n\u201cIs this Lin Xiaowan?\u201d\nThe caller was a woman.\nLin Xianwan\u2019s heart began to race in her chest.\n\n\u201cYes.\n\u201cHello, I\u2019m Song Zhiyi. I wonder if Brother Huo has told you about me.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan\u2019s grip on her phone tightened. She was speechless for a moment.\nWhen Lin Xiaowan returned to her senses, she was already sitting in a cafe.\nAt this time, a woman with curly hair and an oval face walked over and stood in front of her. The woman\u2019s makeup was exquisite, and she wore a smile on her face.\nLin Xiaowan rose to her feet and said, \u201cHello.\u201d\nSong Zhiyi laughed, and a dimple appeared on one of her cheeks. She said, \u201cDon\u2019t be so nervous.\u201d\nSong Zhiyi took a seat on the chair across from Lin Xiaowan. Her movements were elegant and graceful. She casually tucked a strand of hair behind her ear, causing the silver bracelets on her wrist to clink against each other.\nLin Xiaowan studied Song Zhiyi secretly.\n\u2018So she\u2019s Huo Zheng\u2019s first love. She\u2019s so beautiful\u2026 Much more beautiful than those photos\u2026 She\u2019s completely different from me\u2026\u2019\nWhen Song Zhiyi ordered a glass of iced Americano, Lin Xiaowan instinctively glanced at her coconut strawberry milkshake and caramel pudding. She immediately felt like her aura was inferior to that of Song Zhiyi. She could not help but straighten her back.\nSong Zhiyi sized Lin Xiaowan up, making sure that she was superior to the person in front of her. Then, she asked slowly, \u201cHas Brother Huo ever told you about me?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan shook her head. She did not like the way Song Zhiyi addressed Huo Zheng; it was too intimate.\nSong Zhiyi sighed softly. A hint of sadness could be seen in her eyes as she said, \u201cHe probably still blames me.\u201d\nThen, she looked at Lin Xiaowan and continued to say, \u201cYou must be wondering why I called you\u2026 I once promised Brother Huo that even if we separate in the future, we must attend each other\u2019s weddings no matter what\u2026\u201d\nSong Zhiyi\u2019s tone was gentle and without hostility. She sounded just like a gentle sister. However, her words were contrary to her tone.\n\u201cAlthough we separated in the end, I still want to see with my own eyes if he\u2019s happy or not. I didn\u2019t bother you, did I?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan felt that Song Zhiyi truly did bother her.\n\u2018Shouldn\u2019t a good ex act like she\u2019s dead? Why did she show up in front of me and speak like she was declaring sovereignty? How shameless!\u2019\nNaturally, Lin Xiaowan did not give voice to her thoughts. At the same time, she felt like she needed to reconsider her marriage with Huo Zheng.\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly. Thank you so much!\n\n", "4": "https://novellive.com/book/becoming-a-wealthy-familys-beloved-after-her-rebirth/chapter-4\n\n\u201cThen why did the two of you break up?\u201d Lin Xiaowan asked.\nSong Zhiyi, who was holding her glass of coffee, looked as beautiful as an oil painting. She smiled and replied, \u201cWe found that we were more suitable to be friends and broke up peacefully.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan nodded as she thought to herself, \u2018Friends? Earlier, you said, \u2018He must still blame me\u2019. What are you trying to say?\u2019\nLin Xiaowan remained silent and waited for Song Zhiyi to continue speaking.\n\u201cI was with Brother Huo when I was in the second year of junior high school,\u201d\u00a0Song Zhiyi said with a smile on her face as though she was reminiscing about some sweet memories, \u201cHe was very famous in school. When he confessed to me, a group of his followers were there. I was so scared that I couldn\u2019t speak at all. I thought he was going to look for trouble with me\u2026\u201d\n\u201cHowever, despite his fierce reputation, he had always accommodated me. We were together for seven years. Every time we had an argument, he\u2019d come up with different ways to coax me. It was as though he had no bottom line when it came to me.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan quickly calculated in her mind.\nSong Zhiyi and Huo Zheng were together in the second year of junior high school. If they were together for seven years, it meant that they had broken up when they were in university. Seven years was really a long time.\nOn the contrary, from the time Lin Xiaowan met Huo Zheng to the time of her death, it had only been four years.\nSong Zhiyi and Huo Zheng were together for seven years before they realized they were not suitable for each other and decided to break up. However, they could still be friends after that. Did Huo Zheng realize that his ex was more suitable after four years with Lin Xiaowan?\nLin Xiaowan did some calculations again.\nHuo Zheng was 26 years old this year. He should have been 20 or 21 years old when they broke up. That meant that he and Song Zhiyi broke up about five to six years ago.\n\u2018Don\u2019t tell me they have been in contact over the past five or six years?\u2019\nLin Xiaowan felt disgusted thinking about this.\nSong Zhiyi continued to say unprompted, \u201cBack then, he was very different from now. He still had the passion of youth. When he liked me, he wanted the whole world to know about it. He knew I didn\u2019t like eating breakfast so he brought me all kinds of food every morning just to coax me to eat. Even his family\u2019s chef at that time knew my taste in food.\u201d\nSong Zhiyi covered her mouth and laughed coquettishly before she said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ve said too much. I don\u2019t know why, but when I see you, I\u2019m reminded of the past.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan smiled insincerely as she thought to herself, \u2018Said too much? Didn\u2019t you deliberately say all those things for me to hear? If it weren\u2019t because I believe women shouldn\u2019t make things difficult for women, I\u2019d hit you.\u2019\n\nLin Xiaowan punched Song Zhiyi twice in her mind, but she remained calm outwardly.\nSong Zhiyi was slightly irritated when she saw Lin Xiaowan\u2019s indifference. Then, she continued adding fuel to the fire and said, \u201cYou\u2019re actually a little like me in the past. I used to like sweet drinks as well. I also liked to dress childishly. It was innocent and cute.\u201d\nSong Zhiyi paused, pretending to be calm before she continued to say, \u201cWhen Brother Huo told me about it, I didn\u2019t believe him. Now that I\u2019ve met you, I realized he was telling the truth.\u201d\n\u2018F*ck you.\u2019\nLin Xiaowan smiled and listened to Song Zhiyi. When Song Zhiyi left, she could not help but feel both angry and sad. Huo Zheng was her first love. He had always been calm and rational when he was with her. In fact, she did not think there was anything wrong with the way they got along before this. She even liked the calmness of their relationship, thinking that it would make their relationship long-lasting. However, now that there was a comparison, it had roused her dissatisfaction.\nLin Xiaowan had never met Song Zhiyi in her previous life, but she just remembered that she had seen Song Zhiyi\u2019s phone number in her previous life. At that time, she did not hear her phone so Song Zhiyi\u2019s call ended up becoming a missed call. She did not have the habit of returning calls from unknown numbers. Moreover, if it was something important, the other party would likely call again.\nShe wondered if things would be different if she had answered the call in her previous life. Alas, she did not have the answer to her question\n\u2026\nWhen Lin Xiaowan returned home, she began to look for her household registration book. She did not plan to marry Huo Zheng. She wanted to find her household registration book and other important documents before she broke up with Huo Zheng.\nThe more she thought about it, the more she felt that Huo Zheng did not love her at all. He likely only wanted to marry her because she was obedient and sensible, and he was also ready to settle down.\nMeanwhile, the aunt at home; the domestic help, saw Lin Xiaowan turning the house upside down as she looked for something angrily. Seeing how Lin Xiaowan hammered the couch twice as though she was venting her anger, she concluded that Lin Xiaowan failed to find what she was looking for.\nAfter the aunt put the dishes on the dining table, she helped Lin Xiaowan scoop a bowl of rice as she said, \u201cDinner is ready.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan turned her grief and indignation into appetite. In the end, she ended up eating two bowls of rice.\nThe aunt was so shocked, and she quickly refused when Lin Xiaowan asked for a third bowl of rice. She asked worriedly, \u201cAren\u2019t you full?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan was indeed very full. After eating, she lay on the couch, unable to move.\nThe aunt did not know whether to laugh or cry when she brought Lin Xiaowan a digestive pill.\nLin Xiaowan was too lazy to move now so she gave up on her search. Apart from her household registration book, Huo Zheng also kept her passport and other documents that she rarely used. She thought that he likely kept them at the old house.\n\u2026\n\nAfter returning from his business trip, Huo Zheng went directly to the company. He only returned home late at night. When he returned, he found that the lights in the living room were on, and the sound of laughter could be heard from the television.\nLin Xiaowan had fallen asleep, curled up on the couch lazily like a kitten in front of the television. As though she had heard Huo Zheng, she woke up and groggily turned the television off before she rubbed her eyes and yawned.\n\u201cYou\u2019re back.\u201d\nWhen Huo Zheng tried to carry Lin Xiaowan back to the room, she looked at him in disgust and pushed him away before she told him to stay away from her.\nHuo Zheng silently took a seat next to her, wondering what he had done to make her unhappy.\nLin Xiaowan cleared her throat. She looked into Huo Zheng\u2019s deep and dark eyes as she said, \u201cI have something to tell you.\u201d\nShe thought about their time together, and for a moment, she could not bring herself to say the words \u2018break up\u2019. She could not help but feel frustrated with herself.\n\u2018Perhaps, I should ask about Song Zhiyi first? However, what can I change by asking? The two of them broke up five or six years ago. Even if he clarifies things, will I still be able to continue living with him as though nothing happened?\u2019\nLin Xiaowan knew she could not do it. She had to admit that she was jealous of Huo Zheng\u2019s passionate and undisguised love in the past. She was also bothered by his seven-year relationship with Song Zhiyi. In short, there was a huge obstacle standing between her and Huo Zheng.\nHuo Zheng looked at Lin Xiaowan hesitating to speak and could not help but feel slightly anxious. He was about to reach out and hug her when he suddenly froze.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to marry you.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan did not mince her words and directly expressed her thoughts.\n\u201cQingqing\u2026\u201d\nHuo Zheng looked at Lin Xiaowan in disbelief.\nLin Xiaowan glared at him. \u201cStop calling me Qingqing. Qingqing, Qingqing. I\u2019m so sick f*cking sick of hearing that every day. Don\u2019t you have anything better to say?\u201d\nHuo Zheng frowned. \u201cDon\u2019t swear.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell me what to do,\u201d Lin Xiaowan retorted.\nHuo Zheng was in a terrible mood. After all, he discovered that his wife was about to run away as soon as he returned. He really had no idea what went wrong.\nJust like that, the two were in a stalemate.\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

When she did not like something, she would not get angry. Instead, she would tell him what she disliked so he would not do it again.\nThinking about this, Huo Zheng forced himself to calm down and ask, \u201cWhat\u2019s the reason?\u201d\nHuo Zheng\u2019s expression was dark and fierce. Moreover, he was used to being in a high\u00a0and powerful position. Lin Xiaowan could not help but feel slightly frightened by his expression and aura. Nonetheless, she activated her skill to make trouble and said, \u201cThere\u2019s no reason. I just don\u2019t want to be with you anymore.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan took off her ring and placed it on the table as she said, \u201cHere you go. I\u2019m not interested in looking at wedding dresses with you. By the way, is my household registration book with you?\u201d\n\u201cQingqing!\u201d Huo Zheng\u2019s voice was a little stern.\nLin Xiaowan did not dare to look at him and quickly turned away, ignoring him.\nHuo Zheng felt a headache coming on. He wondered if Lin Xiaowan had entered the rebellious phase. After all, she had always been sensible and rational in the past. In order to figure out the thoughts in her head, he softened his tone and said, \u201cMarriage isn\u2019t child\u2019s play, Qingqing\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI know it\u2019s not child\u2019s play,\u201d Lin Xiaowan interjected.\n\u201cLet\u2019s talk this out, okay? Why don\u2019t you want to marry me? Is it because you don\u2019t want a wedding ceremony? We don\u2019t have to have a wedding ceremony if you don\u2019t want one.\u201d\nHuo Zheng came from a traditional family. He was the second son, and his elder brother was married. The first time he brought Lin Xiaowan home, his sister-in-law had nagged him about following traditions to register his marriage and hold a grand wedding for Lin Xiaowan. His sister-in-law also reminded Lin Xiaowan not to get pregnant out of wedlock. The family did not care about what people would say, but they were worried about tarnishing Lin Xiaowan\u2019s reputation. In the end, Lin Xiaowan did not get pregnant out of wedlock, but Huo Zheng was about to lose Lin Xiaowan instead.\n\u201cNo. I don\u2019t care. I just don\u2019t want to be with you,\u201d Lin Xiaowan said stubbornly. In the end, she still could not say the words \u2018break up\u2019.\n\u201cDon\u2019t be like this,\u201d Huo Zheng said. He knew she was angry, and he really wanted to coax her. Alas, he did not know what to do. In the end, he reached out and pulled her into his arms. After kissing her forehead, he said, \u201cTell me what happened, okay? Why don\u2019t you want to be with me?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan struggled a few times but failed to break free. In the end, she bumped his chest with her forehead and did not reply to him.\nThey remained in a stalemate for a long time. Perhaps, due to the familiarity of the embrace and how late it was, exhaustion surged through Lin Xiaowan\u2019s body, and it did not take long before she fell asleep.\nHuo Zheng sighed before he put the ring back on for her and carried her upstairs. At the same time, he thought it was fortunate that she had entrusted him to keep her household registration book and other documents.\n\u2026\nIn the morning.\nThe aunt was steaming beef buns in the kitchen when Huo Zheng walked in.\n\u201cHuh? Mr. Huo, you\u2019re back?\u201d\nHuo Zheng nodded and asked, \u201cWhat has Qingqing been doing over the past two days?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe didn\u2019t do anything out of the ordinary,\u201d the aunt replied, puzzled by Huo Zheng\u2019s question. She thought about it for a moment. Lin Xiaowan had been behaving normally. The only abnormality was\u2026 yesterday.\nWith this thought in mind, the aunt quickly said, \u201cNow that you asked, there was something strange yesterday. Miss Lin suddenly went out yesterday, but when she returned, she was clearly furious. She rummaged through the cabinets in the house, but in the end, it seemed like she couldn\u2019t find what she was looking for. Perhaps she was too angry, she had two bowls of rice during dinner. She was clearly very full so I didn\u2019t dare to let her eat anymore.\u201d\nHuo Zheng nodded and did not ask any more questions. Clearly, something had happened yesterday.\n\u2026\nWhen Huo Zheng arrived at the company, he received a call from his older brother, Huo Cheng.\n\u201cPay attention to the people around you over the next two days. If you discover anything, let me know immediately. Someone around me is getting restless and is about to make a move.\u201d\nThe two Huo brothers were Huo Cheng and Huo Zheng. Huo Cheng, the older brother, was in politics, while Huo Zheng, the younger brother, was in business. The combination of the duo made them very powerful in the country.\nHuo Cheng\u2019s wife was Qiao You\u2019an; the youngest daughter of the Qiao family, which was a prominent family. The marriage helped to forge a strong alliance between the two families.\nThe country of Shangxia, where they lived, was slightly different with distinct social rules and classes.\nShangxia had set up the Office of Military and Political Affairs, and there had been a change of personnel recently. As such, everyone was eyeing the office covetously at this moment. The Huo family was extremely powerful so it was only natural that people were wary of them.\n\u201cGot it,\u201d Huo Zheng said.\nHuo Cheng briefly explained the situation to Huo Zheng, and when he was just about to end the call, Huo Zheng stopped him.\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Huo Cheng asked.\nHuo Zheng remained silent despite stopping his brother from ending the call.\nHuo Cheng waited for a while. When Huo Zheng still did not speak, he wondered for a moment if the call had ended. He glanced at the screen and confirmed the call was still ongoing before he said, \u201cSpit it out if you have something to say.\u201d\nHuo Zheng struggled for a moment. He was really worried that Lin Xiaowan would insist on breaking up. He really did not know what the problem was. The only person whom he could think of to ask advice from was his sister-in-law, Qiao You\u2019an. In the end, he asked Huo Cheng what Qiao You\u2019an had been up to lately.\n\u201cWhy are you asking about my wife?\u201d\nHuo Cheng was still at home at this moment. Qiao You\u2019an was doing morning exercises in the garden with their two sons who were on summer vacation. Coincidentally, she walked over at this moment to get a glass of water. When she heard his words, she asked, \u201cWho are you talking to?\u201d\n\u201cMy brother,\u201d Huo Cheng said, \u201cHe\u2019s beating around the bush just to ask what you\u2019ve been up to recently.\u201d\nThis was indeed strange.\nQiao You\u2019an took the phone from Huo Cheng and asked, \u201cHey, what\u2019s wrong? Is there something you need from me?\u201d\n\n\u201cSister-in-law,\u201d Huo Zheng greeted her politely before he briefly explained the situation to her. To put it simply, his wife was about to run away. He did not know what to do and had no choice but to seek help.\nLin Xiaowan was not a native of the city of Sheng so she did not have many friends here. The only person she could speak to was Qiao You\u2019an.\nLin Xiaowan and Qiao You\u2019an\u2019s relationship had always been pretty good. Upon hearing Huo Zheng\u2019s words, Qiao You\u2019an quickly packed her bags.\nSeeing that his wife was about to rush off with their two sons, Huo Cheng asked, \u201cWhat about me?\u201d\nHuo Cheng had been busy in the past two months. He had been busy burying mines and digging holes for his enemies. He was finally able to ignite the explosive and blew up his enemies, successfully catching his enemies off guard. He could finally take a breather and rest for two days, but before he could even hug his wife, she had left him alone in the empty house.\nQiao You\u2019an glanced at Huo Cheng and said, \u201cThis concerns your brother\u2019s lifelong happiness.\u201d\nHuo Cheng and Qiao You\u2019an\u2019s sons were twins. Their nicknames were \u2018Huo Dabao\u2019 and \u2018Huo Erbao\u2019. When they heard that they were going to see Lin Xiaowan, they were very happy. After all, they liked Lin Xiaowan a lot. They carried their small bags and rushed toward their mother who was standing at the door.\n\u201cMom, let\u2019s go!\u201d\n\u201cMom, don\u2019t talk to Dad anymore!\u201d\n\u201cDaddy, don\u2019t open the door for strangers!\u201d\n\u201cBye, Daddy!\u201d\nHuo Cheng looked at his family speechlessly. After a moment, he gritted his teeth and blocked his brother\u2019s number.\n\u2026\nWhen Lin Xiaowan finally woke up, she saw two missed calls with a three-hour interval and a few messages from Qiao You\u2019an.\n\u2018What\u2019s going on?\u2019\nLin Xiaowan quickly read the messages.\n[Qiao You\u2019an: Xiaowan, why didn\u2019t you answer my call? Are you still sleeping?]\n[Qiao You\u2019an: Xiaowan, I heard that b*stard Huo Cheng bullied you?]\n[Qiao You\u2019an: I\u2019m coming. I brought Dabao and Erbao as well!]\nLin Xiaowen sat up immediately. She ran barefoot to the railing on the second floor, which happened to face the large living room downstairs.\nAs expected, Qiao You\u2019an had already arrived and was watching some melodrama on the television. The volume was turned down, and the living room was relatively quiet. There were no signs of the two children.\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

Although they did not see each other every day, they still saw each other frequently. As such, Lin Xiaowan was very familiar with Qiao You\u2019an.\nLin Xiaowan called out, \u201cSister!\u201d\nLin Xiaowan\u2019s voice was soft and sweet. It even sounded a little childish.\nQiao You\u2019an looked at Lin Xiaowan gently as though she was looking at her precious sons. \u201cYou\u2019re awake.\u201d\n\u2026\nQiao You\u2019an was not in a rush to talk about Huo Zheng. Instead, she and Lin Xiaowan brought the children to the amusement park. With her nanny and the aunt from Huo Zheng\u2019s house, it was extremely easy to look after the children.\nHuo Dabao and Huo Erbao were very fond of Lin Xiaowan. They held her hands and skipped around happily.\nAfter the amusement park, they went to have dinner before they finally went back.\nWhen Lin Xiaowan saw that Dabao and Erbao had fallen asleep in the car, she asked gently, \u201cSister, why don\u2019t you stay the night?\u201d\nQiao You\u2019an still wanted to speak to Lin Xiaowan about Huo Zheng so she readily agreed.\nThe two of them continued chatting before Lin Xiaowan asked hesitantly, \u201cSister, you visited so suddenly today. Did Huo Zheng say something?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan had just mentioned breaking up with Huo Zheng yesterday, and Qiao You\u2019an visited today. Moreover, Qiao You\u2019an also asked if Huo Zheng had bullied her in one of her earlier messages. The reason for Qiao You\u2019an\u2019s visit was obvious.\n\u201cSince you addressed me as \u2018Sister\u2019, I\u2019ll speak bluntly,\u201d Qiao You\u2019an said before she asked, \u201cHuo Zheng said that you wanted to break up. What\u2019s going on?\u201d\nQiao You\u2019an was like Lin Xiaowan\u2019s elder sister. She naturally could not be unreasonable in front of Qiao You\u2019an like she did in front of Huo Zheng. However, she did not know how to answer Qiao You\u2019an\u2019s question. After a moment of silence, she lowered her head and said in a low voice, \u201cHuo Zheng doesn\u2019t seem to like me\u2026\u201d\nSong Zhiyi had intimately addressed Huo Zheng as Brother Huo. On the contrary, Lin Xiaowan had never addressed him in such a way before. Even after three years of marriage, she had always called him by his full name. She did not have any nickname for her husband at all.\nIt was the same for Huo Zheng. He had always addressed her as Qingqing.\n\nAt this time, Huo Zheng recalled the love letter that Huo Zheng wrote. The content was extremely mushy and tender.\nLin Xiaowan was extremely envious. After all, Huo Zheng had never been so intimate with her.\nAfter a moment, Lin Xiaowan stopped herself from thinking about this matter. Otherwise, she would not be able to stop thinking about it, and it would only make her sad.\n\u201cWhy would you think that?\u201d Qiao You\u2019an asked gently as she looked at the downcast Lin Xiaowan. Lin Xiao Wan was originally in high spirits, but her mood fell as soon as Huo Zheng was mentioned. Clearly, there was a huge problem between them.\nLin Xiaowan pursed her lips, finding it hard to speak. Perhaps she had been too reliant on Huo Zheng. After her rebirth, she really could not find any fault in Huo Zheng. The only thing that was wrong was that he had another person he liked. He was so close to another person, but he did not tell her at all. Finally, she asked, \u201cHas Huo Zheng been in a relationship before?\u201d\nQiao You\u2019an was taken aback. She did not expect Lin Xiaowan to ask this question. She tried to recall. When she first met Huo Zheng, he was still in high school. At that time, he indeed had a girlfriend. The other party did not come from a prominent family, and he had brought her home before. The other party was tall and beautiful; her smile was very sweet, and she was very eloquent. She remembered the two of them were together for a long time and even planned to get engaged. However, for some reason, the two of them broke up.\nHuo Zheng was depressed for a long time because of that matter. In the early days after the breakup, he had drunk heavily. He got drunk heavily and fought outside of school all the time. Later on, he gradually recovered, but his personality changed a lot.\n\u201cYes, but the two of them separated many years ago,\u201d Qiao You\u2019an replied. She did not say much. After all, it was all in the past.\nA woman was much more sensitive. Qiao You\u2019an could tell something was wrong so she asked, \u201cWhy did you suddenly ask about this? Does it have anything to do with you wanting to break up with Huo Zheng?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan shook her head and asked again, \u201cHuo Zheng at that time\u2026 What was he like when he was dating?\u201d\nQiao You\u2019an thought about it for a moment, trying to recall Huo Zheng of the past. However, she could not seem to find the right words. In the end, she said in an uncertain tone, \u201cHe was\u2026 enthusiastic\u2026\u201d\nWhen Huo Zheng was young, he was straightforward and passionate about his feelings. He was like the scorching sun and acted flamboyantly. He was from the mature, calm, and restrained person he was now.\n\u2026\nIn the end, the mature, calm, and restrained Huo Zheng did not return home.\nWhen Lin Xiaowan woke up in the morning, there was no one next to her. She thought that Huo Zheng had left early so she casually asked about it at the dining table. However, the aunt said that he did not return at all.\nLin Xiaowan\u2019s expression changed immediately upon hearing this. In her previous life, even before she died, he would come back no matter what, carrying the scent of another woman. He would come every day and had never spent the night outside. However, now, they were not even married yet, but he was already acting like this.\nHuo Dabao and Huo Erbao could tell Lin Xiaowan was unhappy so they quickly leaned over.\n\n\u201cAunty, let\u2019s go and play!\u201d\n\u201cAunty, let\u2019s go and watch a movie together?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan did not have much of an appetite. She followed the two children to the home theatre and watched a cartoon with them.\nHuo Dabao and Huo Erbao always felt happy when they were watching cartoons. In their opinion, Lin Xiaowan would definitely be happy after watching a cartoon with them.\nThe two children let Lin Xiaowan to the couch before they diligently went to the minibar to get soda and snacks. They thoughtfully placed them next to her.\n\u201cWhat else do you want to eat, Aunty?\u201d\n\u201cDo you want to hug a soft toy? Mommy said that girls love soft toys!\u201d\nLin Xiaowan\u2019s depression was immediately swept away. She patted the couch and gestured for the two children to sit down before she said, \u201cHugging the both of you is better than hugging a soft toy.\u201d\nUpon seeing this, Qiao You\u2019an felt that the Second Master of the Huo family was not as good at coaxing girls compared to her two sons. While the others watched the cartoon, she hurried outside and called her husband.\n\u2026\nAt this moment, Huo Cheng was engaged in a bitter battle with a mountainous pile of documents. If he had a tail, it would be wagging at this moment when he saw his wife calling him. Alas, as soon as he answered the call, he was scolded by his wife.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with your brother? His wife is about to run away, but he didn\u2019t even bother to come home last night! He didn\u2019t even say anything. What? Is he trying to make his wife leave even faster?\u201d\nHuo Cheng followed his wife\u2019s words and scolded Huo Zheng as well. After coaxing his wife and ending the call, he quickly unblocked Huo Zheng\u2019s number and called Huo Zheng. However, his call went unanswered.\nHuo Cheng was speechless.\n\u2018Does that b*stard want to die?\u2019\n\u2026\nHuo Zheng lay in bed in a daze when he woke. His life was not a melodrama so he did not do anything like sleep with another person. It was just that he felt uneasy thinking that he had slept in a hotel instead of sleeping at home.\nHe had blacked out the night before.\nSomething unexpected happened yesterday, and it was tricky and troublesome to resolve. Moreover, he had been feeling a little down so he drank a little more. He had gotten really drunk in the end so he asked his assistant to send him to a hotel nearby. Originally, he planned to lie down for a while before calling Lin Xiaowan. Unexpectedly, he fell asleep as soon as his body hit the bed.\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

He could only hear the sound of her breathing.\nAfter a long time, Huo Zheng said, \u201cQingqing, I was a little busy with work yesterday.\u201d\nLin Xianwan pursed her lips, angered by his words. Her tone was clearly not very good when she said, \u201cGot it.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t be angry.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not angry.\u201d\nHuo Zheng was speechless. She was clearly angry.\nLin Xiaowan sighed. There was no point in giving him the silent treatment. She said, \u201cI\u2019m really not angry. Your work is important after all.\u201d\nHowever, Lin Xiaowan became annoyed again. She really did not know where Huo Zheng kept her important documents. Without saying another word, she ended the call.\nHuo Zheng stared at the phone screen for a while after she hung up. Despite her words, he knew she was still angry.\n\u2026\nHuo Zheng returned to the company after he changed his clothes. He called his assistant in and said, \u201cHave a look at the latest bags and jewelry and send them to Madam.\u201d\nIt was not the first time Huo Zheng\u2019s assistant had to pick out presents for his boss. He nodded and quickly left. This was an easy job. Lin Xiaowan was not picky about styles or colors and was very easy to talk to. No matter what was sent to her, she was always happy.\nNot long after, Huo Zheng\u2019s phone rang. When he saw the caller, his aura changed immediately. If his subordinates were around, they would have instinctively held their breaths. He looked a little scary at this moment; his expression was extremely gloomy.\n\u2026\nIn the afternoon.\nHuo Dabao and Huo Erbao were napping. Qian You\u2019an was worried that Lin Xiaowan\u2019s mood would worsen so she invited Lin Xiaowan out to go shopping. She said bluntly, \u201cSpend his money! The Huo brothers are best at making money. If you don\u2019t spend it, are you going to wait for someone else to spend it?\u201d\n\nLin Xiaowan thought about it for a moment. She had not completely broken up with Huo Zheng yet. Who was going to spend Huo Zheng\u2019s money? Song Zhiyi? Dream on!\n\u201cWait for me.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan rushed to her room and rummaged through the cabinets for a long time before she found the card in a pink card holder.\nThe card was given to her indefinitely by Huo Zheng. She could use it as much as she wanted, but she had never used it once in her previous life.\n\u2018If not now, then when?\u2019\nLin Xiaowan put the card in her bag and quickly went downstairs, seemingly in a better mood. She called out, \u201cSister, let\u2019s go shopping! I\u2019ll pay for everything today with Huo Zheng\u2019s card!\u201d\n\u2026\nThe Celine store was particularly busy today. There was a queue in front of the store, and most of the people were exquisitely dressed women. Apparently, a new line of jewelry had been launched.\nLin Xiaowan and Qiao You\u2019an decided to join the fun.\nWhen the sales assistant saw Qiao You\u2019an, she greeted Qiao You\u2019an and showed her the collection enthusiastically.\nAmong the jewelry, there were rings as well. They were not very formal and were very colorful, giving off a young and casual vibe.\nQiao You\u2019an glanced at the simple platinum ring on Lin Xiaowan\u2019s finger and said, \u201cHuo Zheng is too stingy. Why did he buy such a ring to propose? When he comes back, you should ask him for a shiny pigeon-egg-sized ring!\u201d\nLin Xiaowan shrugged and smiled; she did not say anything. However, she clenched her hands and hid them, looking slightly uncomfortable. In her previous life, Huo Zheng had given her an extremely shiny diamond ring.\nLin Xiaowan was a little lost in thoughts. In her previous life, Huo Zheng had personally worn the ring for her during their wedding. Although a diamond was just a stone, he had put a lot of effort into the diamond ring. He had looked around the auction houses all around the world before he finally chose the most beautiful one for her. When that diamond that was worth millions was handed to the designer, the designer had been worried about messing it up.\nLin Xiaowan and Huo Zheng\u2019s marriage was not publicized, and the media was unaware of it. The designer only revealed the beautiful and unique diamond ring without revealing any details after obtaining permission from Huo Zheng.\n\u2026\nAfter leaving the mall, Lin Xiaowan wanted to get milk tea so Qian You\u2019an accompanied her.\nQian You\u2019an looked at Lin Xiaowan and asked, \u201cThis place isn\u2019t far from Huo Zheng\u2019s company. Do you want to drop by for a surprise inspection? \u201d\n\nLin Xiaowan shook her head. \u201cForget it. He\u2019s very busy.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan had no interest in checking up on Huo Zheng. In her previous life, she was caught off guard. The only time she decided to check up on him resulted in her death. In this life, it was better to forget about such a thing.\nLin Xiaowan did not check up on Huo Zheng, but Huo Zheng unexpectedly came to her. To be precise, Huo Zheng and Song Zhiyi came to her unaware.\nThe two of them stood at the entrance of Yiran Restaurant as they chatted. Huo Zheng\u2019s assistant was not with him so it was obvious that he was here for private matters.\nLin Xiaowan\u2019s expression was a little icy while Qiao You\u2019an\u2019s expression was rather terrifying.\nQiao You\u2019an had met Song Zhiyi before, after all. Although Song Zhiyi had changed a lot, she could still recognize Song Zhiyi. She dragged Lin Xiaowan over angrily; almost stomping holes in the ground with her high heels. She said mockingly, \u201cOh, what a coincidence! I heard that Second Young Master Huo was very busy with work. How did he have so much time to come to Yiran Restaurant?\u201d\nQiao You\u2019an usually addressed Huo Zheng by his name. It was clear that she was furious based on how she addressed him as \u2018Second Young Master Huo\u2019.\nHuo Zheng panicked for a moment when he saw Lin Xiaowan and Qiao You\u2019an, but he quickly forced himself to calm down. There were some things he could not explain clearly now.\nSong Zhiyi, who was dressed in a maxi dress, smiled gently and said, \u201cHello, Sister-in-law, long time no see.\u201d\nQiao You\u2019an scoffed. Although she had a good impression of Song Zhiyi when Song Zhiyi first visited the Huo family, she had to consider Lin Xiaowan, who was now Huo Zheng\u2019s partner. She said, \u201cWho\u2019s your sister-in-law? You broke up with Huo Zheng 800 years ago. Currently, apart from the family\u2019s dog, only Xiaowan can call me \u2018Sister-in-law.\u201d\nHuo Zheng, who had just been indirectly compared to the family\u2019s dog, was speechless.\nSong Zhiyi did not seem to take Qiao You\u2019an\u2019s attitude to heart and remained polite. She acted as though this was her first time meeting Lin Xiaowan as she extended her hand to Lin Xiaowan and said, \u201cAre you Xiaowan? Brother Huo spoke about you many times.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan did not expose Song Zhiyi nor did she reach for Song Zhiyi\u2019s hand. Her expression was cold as she said, \u201cNo need.\u201d\nSong Zhiyi was not embarrassed. After the two women\u2019s hostile reception, she only looked at the silent man next to her with a slightly hurt expression and said, \u201cI mean no harm. Did Xiaowan misunderstand something? Brother Huo, you have to explain it clearly.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan rolled her eyes. She remained calm as she scolded, \u201cEven perfume can\u2019t hide your foxy stench. What\u2019s the matter? You can\u2019t find another man after leaving your Brother Huo so you came back to look for him?\u00a0Do you derive pleasure from having an affair with someone\u2019s boyfriend?\u201d\nThen, Lin Xiaowan glanced at Huo Zheng before she continued to say, \u201cOr perhaps, Second Young Master Huo likes the thrill that comes from two-timing me?\u201d\nQiao You\u2019an looked at Lin Xiaowan in shock. After all, Lin Xiaowan was usually very soft and agreeable. She felt as though her understanding of Lin Xiaowan had been refreshed at this moment.\n\u2018You\u2019re quite good at talking!\u2019\nAt the same time, doubts grew in Qiao You\u2019an\u2019s heart as well. Yesterday, Lin Xiaowan had asked if Huo Zheng had been in a relationship before. That meant that Lin Xiaowan did not know about Huo Zheng\u2019s past relationship. However, based on what she had seen so far, it seemed like Lin Xiaowan knew Song Zhiyi.\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

He did not like the way Lin Xiaowan spoke of him. \u201cQingqing, don\u2019t say that.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan sneered.\n\u2018Is this man looking for a slap?\u2019\nSong Zhiyi still did not recover from the shock. During her last meeting with Lin Xiaowan, Lin Xiaowan had been very easy to deal with. She was certain that Lin Xiaowan was very easy to bully. She did not expect Lin Xiaowan to suddenly gain a sharp tongue.\n\u2026\nThe atmosphere remained tense until they reached home.\nQiao You\u2019an received a call from Huo Cheng in the car; he was looking for her for an urgent matter. When they arrived, the chauffeur was already waiting for her. She quickly picked up her sons who had just woken up and left in a hurry.\nBefore Qiao You\u2019an left, she said to Lin Xiaowan worriedly, \u201cIf there\u2019s anything, talk it out. Don\u2019t act rashly, okay?\u201d\nAfter Qiao You\u2019an left, Lin Xiaowan gave the aunt the day off.\nThe aunt had always been on Lin Xiaowan\u2019s side. Although she did not know what happened, she pulled Lin Xiaowan to comfort Lin Xiaowan when she saw the unsightly expression on Lin Xiaowan\u2019s face.\nLin Xiaowan forced a smile on her face and nodded in response to the aunt\u2019s words.\nWhen the house was finally empty, Lin Xiaowan heaved a sigh of relief.\nHuo Zheng wanted to coax Lin Xiaowan and tried to hug her. However, just the sight of him made her angry. How could she allow him to touch her? She flung his hand away with a sour expression. She sat at the edge of the couch alone and asked, \u201cAre you going to explain yourself?\u201d\nHuo Zheng looked at her with dark eyes and replied, \u201cIt\u2019s just work\u2026\u201d\nLin Xiaowan laughed angrily. Huo Zheng\u2019s explanation did not change at all. It had always been work, work, work. Clearly, he accompanied Song Zhiyi for a meal and accompanied Song Zhiyi to pick out a ring in her previous life, but he always blamed it on work.\n\u2018Do I look stupid? Does he think he can simply come up with an excuse to fool me?\u2019\n\nIf she did not answer that call on a whim, she would not have known about Song Zhiyi\u2019s existence. She would have happily gone to try wedding dresses with Huo Zheng. Who knew if Song Zhiyi had been among her wedding guests in her previous life?\nThe more Lin Xiaowan thought about it, the angrier she became. She asked, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me about Song Zhiyi?\u201d\nIn fact, Huo Zheng would have found something suspicious about these words if he were not so preoccupied. After all, he had never mentioned Song Zhiyi before so how did Lin Xiaowan know Song Zhiyi? However, at this moment, he only assumed that Qiao You\u2019an had told Lin Xiaowan about Song Zhiyi so he did not find anything wrong.\n\u201cIt\u2019s all in the past. There\u2019s nothing to talk about,\u201d Huo Zheng said slowly, \u201cI don\u2019t want to make you unhappy.\u201d\nPerhaps it would be fine if Huo Zheng did not say these words. Alas, his words completely triggered Lin Xiaowan.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to make me unhappy? Then, did you think about making me unhappy when you went to see her?\u201d\n\u2018When you were picking rings with her and told me you were busy with work, did you think about making me unhappy or angry?\u2019\n\u201cI went to see her because of work,\u201d Huo Zheng said again.\n\u201cThen, why didn\u2019t you say anything to me? Did you think I\u2019d\u00a0be happier if you secretly went to see her? Do I look happy now?!\u201d Lin Xiaowan asked furiously. She slammed her hand on the table repeatedly as she spoke until it was numb and red. She could not feel any pain at all at this moment.\nLin Xiaowan continued to ask, \u201cWhat kind of work requires you to keep in touch with your ex whom you\u2019ve broken up with many years before? It even requires you to have a private meal!\u201d\nLin Xiaowan\u2019s parents divorced when she was young. The reason was due to her mother having an affair. Most importantly, her mother had an affair with a married man, destroying another person\u2019s family on top of her own.\nYears later, her parents were both married to other people and had children respectively. However, who knew that they would reconcile later on?\nLin Xiaowan\u2019s stepmother found evidence of Lin Xiaowan\u2019s affair first. Although her temper was not very good, she had always treated Lin Xiaowan\u2019s father very well. In the end, she forced herself to endure this matter.\nFor all these reasons, Lin Xiaowan could not tolerate or accept anything that had to do with destroying another person\u2019s family.\nAt this time, Huo Zheng moved to sit next to Lin Xiaowan. Seeing that her palm was red, he quickly held her hand and rubbed it gently.\nLin Xiaowan was annoyed at the sight of him and forcefully pulled her hand away. \u201cDon\u2019t touch me!\u201d\nShe really felt like cursing at this moment.\nHuo Zheng leaned over and said, \u201cYour hand is hurt. Let me rub it for you.\u201d\nHis expression was very serious when he spoke.\n\nLin Xiaowan sighed, feeling helpless. She felt as though she had punched cotton.\nHuo Zheng rubbed her hand before he lightly kissed her red palm. He said softly, \u201cI didn\u2019t have constant contact with her. In fact, ever since we broke up, we\u2019ve had no contact.\u201d\nSong Zhiyi had once been a scar in Huo Zheng\u2019s heart. However, he had already gotten over her. Whenever he thought about her now, he was only filled with disgust. He naturally would not take the initiative to contact her.\nLin Xiaowan took a deep breath before she said, \u201cYou said it\u2019s because of work. Then tell me, what kind of work is it?\u201d\nHuo Zheng fell silent again.\nThere were too many things involved, and it was too complicated. He wanted to protect Lin Xiaowan so he did not want to say too much. It was better to know as little as possible about certain things. In short, the less Lin Xiaowan knew, the safer it would be for her.\nLin Xiaowan sneered. \u201cAlright. I\u2019ll change my question. If we didn\u2019t run into each other today, when were you going to tell me about you and Song Zhiyi?\u201d\nHuo Zheng could not answer this question. After all, he never planned to tell Lin Xiaowan about this for the rest of his life. He had been with Song Zhiyi for too long, and the breakup was awkward. Moreover, he knew very well that no woman would want to listen to their boyfriend\u2019s stories with their exes. Apart from that, he inexplicably did not want Lin Xiaowan to know the reason he and Song Zhiyi broke up.\nHowever, after what happened today, if Lin Xiaowan was persistent about this matter, Huo Zheng decided he would tell Lin Xiaowan about his past after he dealt with Song Zhiyi\u2019s matter.\nHowever, in Lin Xiaowan\u2019s eyes, Huo Zheng\u2019s silence only made it seem like he cherished and cared about his past. In her opinion, it was difficult for him to talk about it because he had yet to let go.\nFinally, she asked, \u201cYou\u2019re never going to tell me, are you?\u201d\nHuo Zheng quickly hugged her, feeling distressed. \u201cDon\u2019t cry.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan took a deep breath. She really did not understand herself recently. In the past, she rarely cried. However, she became fragile after dying once.\n\u201cDid you really not contact her after the breakup?\u201d\n\u201cNo, not even once,\u201d Huo Zheng promised solemnly.\nLin Xiaowan remained silent. Song Zhiyi had implied that she and Huo Zheng remained friends after their breakup. However, even if they were friends, it did not necessarily mean that they kept in touch. The other possibility was that Song Zhiyi was lying.\nLin Xiaowan wanted to believe Huo Zheng, but she remembered her previous life. If Huo Zheng was telling the truth, then what was it she saw in her previous life?\nShe wanted to ask more about Song Zhiyi. However, when she thought about the love letter she had read and Qiao You\u2019an\u2019s evaluation of Huo Zheng when he was young and in love, she found it hard to speak.\nQiao You\u2019an had said that Huo Zheng was enthusiastic, passionate, and straightforward about his feelings when he was in love.\nLin Xiaowan really could not imagine such a Huo Zheng. She would likely die of jealousy if Huo Zheng really recounted his love story with Song Zhiyi.\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

I don\u2019t like her, and I don\u2019t want you to see her even if it\u2019s for work.\u201d\n\u201cSorry, Qingqing.\u201d\nHuo Zheng could not let go of even the slightest thing that could be detrimental to Huo Cheng or the Huo family. If he relaxed and made a mistake, the price he would have to pay would be too great. He could end up dragging the entire Huo family down.\nThe Huo family had been around for centuries. The family business was not completely clean; it had stepped into some gray areas in the past. He had yet to clean everything up, but Song Zhiyi held conclusive evidence.\nThe key figures of the Office of Military and Political Affairs were about to be re-elected; this was the most crucial time. Many people had failed at the very last moment. He had to get rid of all hidden dangers. Song Zhiyi was just bait, and the fish behind her had yet to be caught.\nLin Xiaowan sighed. \u201cYou won\u2019t tell me anything about your work and you won\u2019t stop seeing her. What if both of you decide to get together again?\u201d\nAfter all, seven years were long and not easy to forget.\nSong Zhiyi did not even try to hide her intentions. She was clearly here for Huo Zheng.\nLin Xiaowan had no confidence in herself at all.\n\u201cI promise I won\u2019t!\u201d\nHowever, the way Huo Zheng readily promised Lin Xiaowan did not convince her at all.\n\u201cIs this the first time you\u2019ve seen each other after so long?\u201d Lin Xiaowan asked.\nHuo Zheng hesitated for a few seconds before he answered truthfully, \u201cThis is the third time. The first time was the day before the business trip. Then the second time was\u2026 yesterday\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d Lin Xiaowan asked with a sigh, puzzled, \u201cWhether it\u2019s work or for personal matters, like you said, it\u2019s all in the past. You\u2019re my boyfriend, and you\u2019re even prepared to marry me. Why didn\u2019t you tell me that you were going to meet your ex?\u201d\n\u201cI just\u2026 I was afraid you\u2019d be unhappy with me.\u201d\n\u201cThen, do you think seeing both of you having a meal and chatting happily as though no one is around makes me happy? Do you think I\u2019d be so happy that I\u2019d pretend like nothing happened?\u201d\nHuo Zheng said firmly, \u201cWe weren\u2019t chatting happily as though no one was around. We were just talking about work and\u2026\u201d\nLin Xiaowan did not give Huo Zheng to finish speaking. She said, \u201cWork, work, work. All you do is blame your work.\u201d\nThe two of them fell silent again.\nLin Xiaowan suppressed her emotions before she calmly said, \u201cHuo Zheng, it bothers me that the person sleeping next to me is involved with a woman who clearly has a motive.\u201d\nHuo Zheng realized what Lin Xiaowan was about to say and called out anxiously, \u201cQingqing\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not being impulsive,\u201d Lin Xiaowan said calmly as she looked into Huo Zheng\u2019s eyes. She stayed in his embrace, and it seemed as though she had returned to her usual gentle self at this moment as she continued to say, \u201cWe got together too quickly. If you think considering breaking up is impulsive, then it was even more impulsive when we got together\u2026\u201d\n\u201cNo, no, it wasn\u2019t impulsive when we got together,\u201d Huo Zheng hurriedly denied.\nLin Xiaowan looked at Huo Zheng, feeling a little tired. \u201cHowever, I feel that it was impulsive. Since you need to work with Song Zhiyi, I think we should take a break during this period of time.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan and Huo Zheng\u2019s relationship was very sudden. It was summer vacation at that time. She had just graduated and had yet to find a job. As such, she decided to work part-time at the amusement park north of the city.\nOne day, the amusement park had a garden party. At that time, she coincidentally ran into Huo Dabao and Huo Erbao who had gotten lost. Huo Dabao held Huo Erbao\u2019s hand and politely asked Lin Xiaowan if she could bring them to the amusement park\u2019s office. He said he was lost and wanted it to be announced on the broadcasting system.\nLin Xiaowan took an instant liking to the two cute, obedient, and sensible children. Not only did she bring them to their destination, but she also bought them fruit juice and ice cream. The two children politely declined before they finally accepted them, looking serious and cute.\nCoincidentally, Huo Zheng was the one who brought the two children to the amusement park. Huo Cheng and Qiao You\u2019an wanted to spend a few days alone. That was how Lin Xiaowan met Huo Zheng. At that time, to express his gratitude, they even had a meal together. That was the first time she had eaten in such an expensive restaurant. She had been flabbergasted when she saw the bill. What she earned in a month was not even enough to cover the bill.\nA few days later, Huo Dabao and Huo Erbao called and invited Lin Xiaowan to their house. Initially, she declined the invitation because of work. Missing a day\u2019s work meant that she would lose a day\u2019s pay. She could not bear to part with the 200 yuan she would earn.\n\nAt that time, Huo Dabao asked seriously, \u201cThen, can I hire you as a guest to come to my house?\u201d\nHuo Erbao nodded and chimed in, \u201cBrother and I have a lot of pocket money so we can pay you!\u201d\nAfter that, the two children really showed her their money and even asked if 5,000 yuan was enough.\nLin Xiaowan jumped in fright when she heard their words. If she had no conscience and it was not illegal, she would have taken the money and run away. In the end, she did not accept the money from them, but she took a day off to visit them.\nHuo Zheng seemed to have heard about the matter. At that time, he waited until she was done telling them a bedtime story before he spoke to her. He asked her if she was willing to stay for a few days. It would be considered a job, and he would pay her. He had been having a hard time taking care of the children, and he was amazed by how she was able to tame the two children. He felt that it was almost magical.\nLin Xiaowan agreed, and her short and special job ended when Qiao You\u2019an and Huo Cheng returned. However, Huo Zheng did not cut off contact after that. They continued talking until September when she told him she was leaving. At that time, he asked her if she was willing to stay. With him, she could do whatever she wanted and did not have to worry about money. After that, they got along until now\u2026\n\u2026\nOn the first night of their official break, Huo Zheng slept in the guest room for the first time.\nFrom the day they moved in, the guest room had been left empty. This was the first time they had slept in separate bedrooms under the same roof.\nIn fact, Lin Xiaowan had volunteered to sleep in the guest room. Although the house was bought under both their names, Huo Zheng had paid for it. She had been with him after graduating, and her last job was at the amusement park. How could she have saved up enough money to buy a house?\nHuo Zheng rejected her expressionlessly after she offered to sleep in the guest room. He watched her enter their bedroom before he went to the guest room.\nNeither of them slept well that night.\n\u2026\nLin Xiaowan tossed and turned in bed. Now that they had broken up, she could not continue staying here. However, the rental in Sheng City was not something she could afford. She did not have any savings after all. If she went back to her hometown, a small county in the north, she would probably not see Huo Zheng again.\n\u2026\nIn the morning.\nThe two of them sat at the dining table, looking tired. They ate breakfast silently.\nThe aunt had already returned, and when she sensed that the atmosphere between the two was not right, she did not dare to say anything.\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

After eating, she cleared her throat, seeing that Huo Zheng had no intention of speaking. She asked, \u201cIs my household registration book with you?\u201d\nHuo Zheng nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s in the old house.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan did not know why he kept it there, but she did not ask. She touched her nose and said, feeling slightly awkward, \u201cI\u2019ll go and get it in the next two days. You should remove my name from this house. I plan to move out in two days.\u201d\n\u201cMove out?\u201d Huo Zhen raised his head immediately.\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cWhy are you moving out?\u201d\n\u201cUh, we\u2019ve broken up, right?\u201d\n\u2018What kind of question is that? How can we still stay together after breaking up?\u2019\nHuo Zheng stared at her intently and said, \u201cYou said that it\u2019s a temporary break. Where do you plan to go?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan lowered her head and said softly, \u201cHome.\u201d\n\u201cStay here. I won\u2019t give you your household registration book, and you\u2019re not allowed to leave,\u201d Huo Zheng said, rising to his feet. His aura was so oppressive that Lin Xiaowan did not dare to raise her head at all.\nHuo Zheng\u2019s words were domineering and unreasonable, but Lin Xiaowan did not dare to refute them. Not only that, but she actually felt relieved. She thought to herself, \u2018Ah, it seems like he really can\u2019t bear to part with me.\u2019\nHowever, at the same time, she felt really shameless as well. She proposed to break up with him, but at the same time, she did not want to leave. It was as though she was deliberately trying to lead him on. She felt like she was really a b*tch.\nSeeing that Lin Xiaowan did not say anything, Huo Zheng thought that she was still adamant about leaving. When his eyes fell on the ring on her finger, he deliberately asked, \u201cWhere do you think you\u2019re going wearing my ring?\u201d\nHuo Zheng was already in a bad mood because of the breakup; his mood only worsened when Lin Xiaowan said she wanted to move out. As such, when he spoke, his words and voice were unintentionally cruel and cold in Lin Xiaowan\u2019s ears. He only wanted her to stay, but in her ears, it did not sound that way.\nLin Xiaowan was originally holding a small bowl of porridge. However, when she heard his words, she instinctively withdrew her hand and touched her ring under the table. Initially, she wanted to keep the ring even after the breakup. However, based on his words, it seemed like he was not willing to let her keep it.\n\u2018How annoying. Previously, when I returned it to him, he didn\u2019t want it. Today, he doesn\u2019t want me to wear it\u2026\u2019\nFinally, Lin Xiaowan took the ring off. She placed it on the table and pushed it toward him.\n\u2018So be it. I\u2019ll just return it to him.\u2019\n\nHuo Zheng grew even angrier when he saw her actions. Without saying another word, he left, slamming the door behind him loudly.\nLin Xiaowan froze, shocked. He had never been so angry or fierce to her before so she was a little frightened.\nEven the aunt, who was in the kitchen, was shocked. She had never seen Huo Zheng lose his temper ever since she started working here. He was already intimidating enough on normal days, but he was even more terrifying when he lost his temper.\nSeeing that Lin Xiaowan was alone, the aunt came over and asked, \u201cIs the porridge cold? It\u2019s bad for your stomach if you eat it cold.\u201d\nWhen Lin Xiaowan looked up, the aunt saw her eyes were red and teary.\nLin Xiaowan wiped her tears with her sleeve. She had lost her appetite to eat. She pushed the bowl away and stood up, looking sad as she said, \u201cAunty, have you eaten? You should eat. I don\u2019t want to eat anymore.\u201d\nThe aunt sighed.\n\u2026\nHuo Zheng left in the morning, and he did not return at night. However, this time, he sent an address to Lin Xiaowan, telling her that he would stay there in the future.\nLin Xiaowan was alone at home. No matter what she did, she could not raise her spirit.\n\u2026\nThe Huo family\u2019s old mansion was in the suburbs of Maple Mountain. It was very far, and Lin Xiaowan did not know the way. The chauffeur worked for Huo Zheng so he definitely would not drive her there. However, she really wanted her household registration book and other documents. In the end, after hesitating for a while, she called Qiao You\u2019an for help. Unfortunately, Qiao You\u2019an did not answer the call.\nAfter a few days passed, Qiao You\u2019an still did not return the call.\nLin Xiaowan did not like to trouble others. Since the other party did not return the call, she also did not call again.\n\u2026\nHalf a month passed, and Huo Zheng and Lin Xiaowan did not contact each other.\nLin Xiaowan did not like going out so she was cooped up at home every day. She was often lost in her thoughts.\nSeeing the state she was in, the aunt even advised her to go for walks.\nOne day, the aunt asked her, \u201cI\u2019m going to the supermarket. Do you want to come with me?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan agreed. She liked snacks so she bought a lot of them.\n\nThe aunt felt much happier when she saw this. At the same time, she sighed at how simple Lin Xiaowan was. Nonetheless, it was good that she could divert Lin Xiaowan\u2019s attention.\nHuo Zheng, the master of the house, had not been home for so many days. The aunt naturally knew that something had happened, but it was not her place to ask questions. There was nothing she could do either. She could only do her best to cheer Lin Xiaowan up.\n\u2026\nLin Xiaowan did not stay happy for long. As soon as she arrived home, the smile on her face vanished, and she became unhappy again.\nShe missed Huo Zheng very much. After all, they had been together for a while. In her previous life, Huo Zheng had long integrated with her life. Now that she was suddenly alone in a place filled with memories, it was inevitable that she would feel sad.\nAlas, Huo Zheng did not contact her, and she was too embarrassed to contact him. After all, she was the one who proposed to break up. No matter how uncomfortable it felt, she had to get used to it.\nLin Xiaowan flipped through the calendar and recalled events from her previous life. Her heart was extremely heavy. No matter what, she had to return to her hometown before the end of the year.\n\u2026\nAutumn arrived in just a blink of an eye.\nWhen the weather turned cold, Lin Xiaowan was even more unwilling to leave the house. She could sleep up to ten hours a day; it was as though she was hibernating even though it was only October. Apart from that, she also ate very little.\nOnce in a while, when she went shopping with the aunt, she felt as though she was being watched. She would look around suspiciously, making the aunt nervous.\nIt was the same today. Lin Xiaowan did not walk very far before the feeling of being watched and followed appeared again. However, she looked back a few times but did not see anyone. She stopped in her tracks, feeling anxious.\nThe aunt did not think Lin Xiaowan was overthinking things. She had read many reports about women who lived alone being stalked, robbed, or killed. She knew this was not a small matter.\nEver since Lin Xiaowan began to feel suspicious, she had begun to pay attention to suspicious markings on the house. She even placed Huo Zheng\u2019s leather shoes outside the door just to be safe.\nAfter a while, nothing happened, but Lin Xiaowan still felt as though she was being watched and followed whenever she left the house.\nThe aunt looked around as well. There were only a few pedestrians in the neighborhood, and it was extremely quiet. There was nothing but the sound of wind.\nThe two of them continued walking forward.\nSeeing that Lin Xiaowan was anxious, the aunt suggested, \u201cShould we call the police just in case?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan shook her head and quickly pulled the aunt away. It was only when there were more people around them that she felt slightly more at ease.\nLin Xiaowan knew that there was no point in lodging a report. The police would only think she was being paranoid and would not take this matter seriously.\nIt was also for this reason that Lin Xiaowan was even more reluctant to leave the house.\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

When I went out, I didn\u2019t feel anyone following me or watching me. Is the other party targeting you?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan did not have the answer to this question as well. She really wanted to move, but she did not know where to go. Even if she returned to her hometown, she did not have a place to stay. She would have to find a house to rent first. She had checked various rental apps for places to rent in her hometown in the north. Rentals were cheaper in a small city, and they were even cheaper places further away from the heart of the city. In the end, she found a place in an old neighborhood. It was a 90-square-meter three-bedroom apartment that only cost 600 yuan.\nHowever, every night, she would make up her mind to leave, but when she woke up the next day, she would hesitate again.\nAfter sending her the address, Huo Zheng did not come home nor did he contact again.\n\u2026\nAt this moment, Huo Zheng sat expressionlessly in Huo Cheng\u2019s office. He emitted a dark aura as he read a document.\nAn intern entered the office tremblingly and reported some matters to Huo Cheng. As soon as she was done and Huo Cheng nodded, she hurried out of the office as though she had seen a ghost.\nUpon seeing this, Huo Cheng said with a helpless expression on his face, \u201cWhy are you here when you have nothing to do here? You\u2019re going to scare everyone to death with that face of yours.\u201d\nHuo Zheng did not reply nor did he look at Huo Cheng.\nHuo Cheng continued to say, \u201cIf you really miss your wife, you can sneak back to see her. If you\u2019re worried about her, then send her somewhere far away. Isn\u2019t her hometown in the northern city? You\u2019ve broken up, and she\u2019s also said that she wanted to leave. You should let her leave. During this time, the further away she is from you, the safer she\u2019ll be.\u201d\nHuo Zheng\u2019s expression was unsightly as he said, \u201cWe didn\u2019t break up. The northern city is too far away. I\u2019m worried something will happen there.\u201d\nHuo Cheng thought about it for a moment. Song Zhiyi had already met Lin Xiaowan. If they moved Lin Xiaowan too far away, it would be bad if Song Zhiyi or the people behind her decided to make a move against Lin Xiaowan. Indeed, it would be easier to keep an eye on Lin Xiaowan if she was close to them.\nFinally, Huo Cheng said, \u201cI told you to send her to the Qiao family. My wife is there anyway. I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re unwilling to do so.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t want her to get too involved with us,\u201d Huo Zheng said. As he spoke, he grew frustrated again. He and Lin Xiaowan were clearly in the same city, but it had been a long time since he had seen her. Every day, he had to wrack his brain for the Huo family; he was also worried about Lin Xiaowan. Fortunately, she had always been very sensible.\nNonetheless, Huo Zheng was still angry and helpless about the breakup. In his opinion, as long as he made her stay, he would not have anything to worry about after the dust settled. At that time, he would have a good talk with her and tell her everything she wanted to know. He would not hide anything from her at that time.\nThe more Huo Zheng thought about it, the more he found that he could not concentrate on the document in his hands. In the end, he simply threw the document on the ground and closed his eyes to rest.\n\nOn the other hand, Huo Cheng was not doing too well either. His position was too crucial, and many people were eyeing him from all directions now. He had to constantly guard against open and secret attacks. The mastermind behind Song Zhiyi had yet to show up, and he was completely tied up by the information in Song Zhiyi\u2019s hands. Just like how Huo Zheng had not seen Lin Xiaowan for a long time, he also had not seen Qiao You\u2019an and his two sons for a long time now.\nHu Dabao and Hu Erbao had been pulled out of school recently due to safety concerns. Moreover, they could not trust tutors to homeschool the two children so in the end, the task of homeschooling the children was given to family members.\nHuo Cheng thought of something at this moment and said, \u201cHey, don\u2019t blame me for being nosy, but don\u2019t you still have a helper at home with Xiaowan? In my opinion, you should fire her. She\u2019s an outsider after all. If she were to be blinded by her greed, who knows what will happen.\u201d\n\u201cI understand,\u201d Huo Zheng said with his eyes still closed.\nThe more Huo Cheng thought about it, the more aggrieved he felt. He did not even know when he lost such a thick stack of documents and account books; he had not brought them out after putting them away after all. It was highly likely that Song Zhiyi had acted many years ago when she visited the Huo family.\nHuo Cheng could not help but curse, \u201cThat dogshit ex-girlfriend of yours is really a f*cking disaster!\u201d\nHuo Zheng did not say anything, but his expression was dark.\n\u2026\nWhen Lin Xiaowan learned that the aunt was leaving, she was shocked. She asked, perplexed, \u201cWhy?\u201d\nThe aunt naturally did not know the reason either. She only received a call from the agency in the morning, informing her that her work was over and to move out as soon as possible. The agency even asked her if she needed them to look for a new job for her. Since her contract had yet to expire, Huo Zheng compensated her with a large amount of money for the early termination of the contract. As such, she could not even say anything.\nAt this moment, Lin Xiaowan\u2019s eyes suddenly widened, and she asked, \u201cDid Huo Zheng do this?\u201d\nThe aunt did not answer the question and left soon after.\nLin Xiaowan was now the only one left in the huge house after the aunt\u2019s departure. Even the cook no longer came. Her three meals were now delivered by servants from the Huo family.\nShe really could not figure out what Huo Zheng was up to.\nWithout the aunt, Lin Xiaowan was even more afraid to leave the house. She was truly afraid of being watched. Even when she went out to throw the trash, her heart would pound in her chest, making it difficult for her to breathe.\nApart from that, Lin Xiaowan also had difficulty falling asleep. She often woke up in the middle of the night with palpitations, wondering if someone was hiding in the dark house. She would turn on the lights in her room and clutched her phone tightly, frightened out of her wits. She was overwhelmed by the urge to call Huo Zheng several times but managed to resist in the end.\nOn such nights, she would sit until the sky turned bright before she allowed herself to fall asleep curled up on the couch.\n\n\u2026\nIt was not until Lin Xiaowan\u2019s birthday that Huo Zheng returned.\nThe weather was very cold now. Apart from throwing out the trash once a week, Lin Xiaowan did not go out at all.\nAt this time, Lin Xiaowan was hugging her knees and watching a drama on the television. She did not like watching dramas in the past due to their convoluted plots or bad storyline. However, now, they became her way to kill time.\nWhen the doorbell suddenly rang, Lin Xiaowan trembled and quickly muted the drama. Her heart rate quickly shot up to 180 bpm. She slowly walked to the door and looked through the peephole. When she saw that it was Huo Zheng, the tension eased immediately, and she felt dizzy from the relief.\nShe held the doorknob and took a few deep breaths to calm down before she opened the door like nothing was wrong.\nWhen Huo Zheng saw her pale face, his heart tightened. He thought she was sick so he asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan shook her head and stepped aside to let him in.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t look well,\u201d Huo Zheng said. When he tried to hold Lin Xiaowan\u2019s hand, she quickly avoided him.\n\u201cMaybe I slept for too long,\u201d Lin Xiaowan said.\nLin Xiaowan missed Huo Zheng terribly. She thought about him every day. When she closed her eyes, she thought about their past, and sometimes, she would think about his past with Song Zhiyi.\nHowever, now that Lin Xiaowan saw Huo Zheng, she did not know what to say.\nThe two of them walked into the living room.\nHuo Zheng placed the colorful bags with brand names on the ground in a row before he took a seat.\nSilence continued to permeate the house, but Lin Xiaowan felt at ease. It had been two months, and she had been living in fear. She would turn on the lights at night and check the house carefully. She would only turn off the lights when dawn came.\nWith Huo Zheng\u2019s presence, even if he was only sitting silently, Lin Xiaowan felt extremely relaxed. She wished she could just lie down and sleep at this moment. However, despite her wish, she asked, \u201cAre you done with your work?\u201d\nHuo Zheng shook his head. \u201cNo.\u201d\nThen, after a brief pause, he added, \u201cIt\u2019ll be done soon.\u201d\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly. Thank you so much!\n\n", "12": "https://novellive.com/book/becoming-a-wealthy-familys-beloved-after-her-rebirth/chapter-12\n\nLin Xiaowan did not have anything to say in response. Suddenly, she recalled her birthday wish in her previous life. She suddenly blurted out without thinking, \u201cWhen you\u2019re done with your work, can we visit the North Pole? I want to see the northern lights!\u201d\nHuo Zheng was delighted when he heard her request. He quickly said, \u201cAlright. I\u2019ll bring you there when I\u2019m done with my work.\u201d\nIn his opinion, since Lin Xiaowan was willing to go on a holiday with him, it meant that she no longer wanted to break up.\nAt this moment, Lin Xiaowan\u2019s eyes fell on the various bags on the ground and asked, \u201cWhy did you bring so many things over?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s your birthday today.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan was stunned. When she returned to her senses, she brought her phone out to check the date. It was indeed her birthday. She had been muddle-headed these days and had lost track of the days. She had completely forgotten about her birthday.\nSensing that something was amiss, Huo Zheng asked, \u201cQingqing, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d\nHuo Zheng wanted to test the water so he quickly reached out to hug her. It would be best if he could kiss her as well. Alas, the moment his hand touched her, she shivered in fear and dodged to the side.\nConfused, Huo Zheng leaned over to comfort her as he asked worriedly, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Qingqing? Can I hug you?\u201d\nHe spoke softly, afraid of further frightening her.\nLin Xiaowan felt extremely jittery at this moment. In fact, she had instinctively dodged him. When she saw his open arms, she asked without thinking, \u201cDo you also hug Song Zhiyi like this?\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s not talk about her, okay?\u201d Huo Zheng said with a sigh as he withdrew his hands.\nIt seemed as though Lin Xiaowan did not hear his words as she continued to press on. She asked, \u201cDid you meet Song Zhiyi again during this period of time?\u201d\nHuo Zheng nodded with great difficulty. \u201cYes. I\u2019m sorry, Qingqing. I have no choice but to see her.\u201d\nThen, he asked again, \u201cLet\u2019s not talk about her anymore, okay?\u201d\n\nLin Xiaowan lowered her head silently.\nHuo Zheng slowly pulled her into his embrace and held her hands. Her hands were small, and her fingers were short and chubby. He found them very cute. After a moment, he asked worriedly, \u201cWhy are your hands so cold?\u201d\nAlthough Lin Xiaowan did not respond to him, he continued to ask gently, \u201cWhat do you want to eat tonight? Pork ribs with preserved plums? Snowflake Beef Tenderloin? You have to eat more vegetables. You can\u2019t be picky.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan felt that this was not right. How could they behave intimately like a couple when they had broken up? How could she live in his house when they had broken up?\nFinally, she mustered up her courage and said, \u201cI want to go home.\u201d\nHuo Zheng did not know why she brought this topic up again. He paused for a moment before he said anxiously, \u201cQingqing, this is your home. You promised me you wouldn\u2019t leave. Wait for me a little longer. After this matter is settled, Song Zhiyi will never appear in our lives again. At that time, if you still want to break up, I\u2019ll pursue you again, okay?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan shook her head and said, \u201cYou always want me to wait for you. I want to go home.\u201d\n\u201cDidn\u2019t we just talk about going to the North Pole to see the northern lights? Don\u2019t you want to go?\u201d Huo Zheng asked, coaxing her as though he was coaxing a child. His eyes could not hide his anxiety, but his voice was gentle.\nLin Xiaowan had not been sleeping well recently and was in low spirits. Huo Zheng\u2019s gentle voice made her feel a little dazed. She muttered, \u201cI keep feeling like someone\u2019s watching me. Wherever I go, I feel like someone\u2019s secretly watching me.\u201d\nThe invisible gaze made her hair stand on end, and it almost drove her crazy.\nHuo Zheng sighed in relief when he realized this was the reason she wanted to go home. He quickly said, \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid. They\u2019re not bad people. They\u2019re here to protect you.\u201d\nUpon hearing these words, Lin Xiaowan sobered up immediately. She suddenly pushed Huo Zheng away and looked at him in disbelief as she asked, \u201cAre they your people?\u201d\nHuo Zheng nodded calmly. Clearly, he did not think he had done anything wrong. He said, \u201cIt\u2019s to ensure your safety.\u201d\n\u2018To ensure my safety?\u2019\nLin Xiaowan almost laughed out loud.\nDue to the constant surveillance, she lived on tenterhooks every day. She was paranoid and uneasy, constantly tense. The eyes that stared terrified her. Now that she found out Huo Zheng was responsible for this matter, how could she not be angry?\n\n\u201cEnsure my safety? Why didn\u2019t you say anything if you wanted to protect me? Why right do you have to keep me under surveillance or monitor me? Are you crazy, Huo Zheng? Why did you send people to keep an eye on me without telling me anything? Why didn\u2019t you tell me?!\u201d\nNearing the end of her words, Lin Xiaowan screamed hysterically.\nHuo Zheng did not understand Lin Xiaowan\u2019s anger at all. He said, \u201cI\u2019m not keeping you under surveillance or monitoring you. I\u2019m protecting you.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan felt as though she was going to go crazy from anger. She did not understand how Huo Zheng could be so calm. She was so angry that her hands shook. When she saw the bags, she pushed them over and shouted, \u201cWhy do I need protection? Why? Is it to stop me from going out or is it to stop me from sneaking away? I don\u2019t need this kind of protection!\u201d\nHuo Zheng\u2019s so-called protection made her afraid to go out, afraid to sleep, and afraid of life.\nLin Xiaowan\u2019s hair was disheveled, and her face was ashen at this moment.\nHuo Zheng did not understand Lin Xiaowan\u2019s feelings at all. He had a headache from her overreaction, but he kept coaxing her like he did in the past. \u201cAlright, alright, calm down, okay? When this matter is over, I\u2019ll send those people away.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan looked at Huo Zheng in disbelief. \u201cI said I don\u2019t need the protection. Do you understand what I\u2019m saying, Huo Zheng?\u201d\n\u201cBe good, okay? I\u2019m really trying to protect you,\u201d Huo Zheng said as he leaned over to tidy her hair.\nLin Xiaowan swatted his hand away, not holding back her strength as she did so. She said angrily, \u201cGet lost! Don\u2019t touch me!\u201d\nHuo Zheng felt a little angry at this moment. He was doing all these for her good, after all. This was an important time, and enemies of the Huo family were looking for an opportunity to make a move. He was truly worried they would target Lin Xiaowan. However, she did not seem to understand him at all. He said darkly, \u201cThere\u2019s no room for discussion regarding this matter. Someone has to keep an eye on you.\u201d\nHuo Zheng realized he sounded a little harsh so he quickly softened his tone and said, \u201cXiaowan, can you please listen to me?\u201d\nSeeing that Huo Zheng did not listen to her at all, she stood up angrily, intending to scold him again. Perhaps she had stood up too quickly, her vision turned black, and she fainted.\nHuo Zheng was shocked and quickly reached out to catch her.\nLin Xiaowan was only unconscious for a few seconds. When she regained her senses, she did not even know she had fainted; she only thought it was a bout of dizziness. When she realized she was in Huo Zheng\u2019s arms, she immediately struggled to free herself from him.\n\u201cQingqing, Qingqing, listen to me\u2026 I promise that once this matter is over, no one will keep an eye on you,\u201d Huo Zheng said. He was worried she would faint again so he did not dare to hold her too tightly. He could only watch helplessly as she huddled on the other side of the couch.\nLin Xiaowan did not want to listen to him anymore. She only said, \u201cI want to leave tomorrow.\u201d\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

He would only feel at ease if he could keep Lin Xiaowan somewhere safe. If she left and something happened, he was really worried he would not be able to protect her. His temper rose at this moment, and he said in a tone that brooked no arguments, \u201cNo. Stay here obediently. You\u2019re not allowed to go anywhere.\u201d\nHuo Zheng\u2019s words and tone were really unpleasant to hear. It was like an order.\n\u2018Isn\u2019t this just like a house arrest?\u2019\nLin Xiaowan glared at him and cursed, \u201cF*ck you! You\u2019re violating my personal freedom!\u201d\nHuo Zheng lowered his head and apologized to her, but he refused to give in. However, seeing how adamant she was, he compromised reluctantly and told her that he would arrange for fewer people to keep an eye on her.\n\u201cJust two. I\u2019ll leave two people to watch over you, okay? It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t allow you to go home. Just wait. When this matter is over, I\u2019ll personally send you back.\u201d\nThis was Huo Zheng\u2019s bottom line.\nAfter hearing this and venting her anger, Lin Xiaowan finally felt better and had dinner with Huo Zheng.\nThe meal that was sent over was prepared by the Huo family\u2019s chef. Along with it was a chocolate and strawberry cream cake to celebrate Lin Xiaowan\u2019s 23rd birthday. The cake was to her liking, and even the candles were in the shape of little animals.\nAfter eating the cake, Lin Xiaowan finally felt better. Her expression eased.\nUpon seeing this, Huo Zheng sighed in relief as he thought to himself, \u2018At least I didn\u2019t mess everything up\u2026\u2019\n\u2026\nOver the next few days, Lin Xiaowan did not make a fuss. After thinking about it, she tried to empathize with Huo Zheng. Perhaps, he really had his reasons for his actions. Hence, she forced herself to stay in the house.\nIn the afternoon, Lin Xiaowan felt uneasy and kept getting distracted. When she woke up from her nap, she lay on the bed in a daze for a long time. She looked at the calendar and found that there was a week left until the marked date.\nShe felt restless as though something heavy was weighing her heart down. Not only was she overly anxious, but she also felt like crying. For some inexplicable reason, she really craved the crispy and salty desserts from Huaiyang Bakery at the intersection of Yuhu Northern Road.\nHuo Zheng did not say she could not go out. Over the past few days, when she went out to throw the trash, she felt like the gazes on her were not as intense as before. However, they still gave her goosebumps.\n\nIn the end, she decided to change her clothes and leave the house.\nThe high-end neighborhood was far from the heart of the city so it was not easy to get a cab. She stood by the roadside for a while, wondering if she should call for a cab from the app instead when a low-key black Volkswagen pulled to a stop in front of her.\nThe driver was an ordinary-looking young man. His face was easily forgettable.\n\u201cMiss Lin, where are you going?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan clutched her phone tightly and did not dare to speak.\nSeeing Lin Xiaowan\u2019s wariness and fear, the young man showed his ID and said, \u201cI\u2019m Mr. Huo\u2019s man.\u201d\nAt the same time, he dialed Huo Zheng\u2019s number. After two rings, the call connected, and the young man handed the phone to Lin Xiaowan.\nLin Xiaowan called out hesitantly, \u201cHello?\u201d\nHuo Zheng\u2019s voice rang from the other end of the line.\n\u201cYou can let him drive you when you go out. Don\u2019t talk to strangers. If someone calls you, just ignore them. Understand?\u201d\nAfter that, Huo Zheng asked gently, \u201cWhere are you going, Qingqing?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan let down her guard completely when she heard Huo Zheng\u2019s voice. She replied, \u201cI want to buy something.\u201d\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you wait at home? I\u2019ll get someone to send the things to you?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I want to buy it myself.\u201d\n\u201cAlright. Then, go home after you\u2019re done shopping?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cGood.\u201d\n\nAfter the call ended, Lin Xiaowan got into the car and went to Huaiyang Bakery. Apart from the crispy and salty desserts, she also bought 500 grams of walnuts, a date cake, and a coconut cake. Then, she returned home without any incident.\n\u2026\nLin Xiaowan ate quite a lot, but her heart still felt empty. She looked at the marked date on the calendar again. In her previous life, her father passed away during this period of time.\nLin Xiaowan did not have many contacts on her phone. Her parents had divorced early and remarried with their own respective families. She was left at her grandparents\u2019 house at that time. Her grandmother had a strong preference for boys so she would scold her for everyone to hear. At home, her grandmother would not only scold her, but scold her mother as well; her grandmother would also pick on her. Ever since she was young, she had lived such a life. At first, it was still fine when her grandfather was around. However, when her grandfather passed away when she was in junior high school, the situation worsened.\nLin Xiaowan\u2019s father was so focused on his new family that he did not have time to care about her. Moreover, her aunt did not like her. Her aunt would hide all the fruits, vegetables, desserts, and biscuits she bought, and she often did not have food to eat. Apart from paying her school fees, her father had no contact with her at all.\nAs for Lin Xiaowan\u2019s mother, she would give Lin Xiaowan pocket money, but she was very strange. Whenever they met, she would beat, scold, and humiliate Lin Xiaowan. Lin Xiaowan really did not know what her mother was thinking.\nWhen Lin Xiaowan started working part-time in high school, her mother passed away from cancer. Then, when she became an adult, she changed her household register and went to Sheng City University. She had never returned since then.\nHer familial ties were not deep. She did not spend much time with her parents and relatives since she was young.\nAlthough she kept telling Huo Zheng she wanted to go home, she actually did not have a home in Beicheng, her hometown. Her situation in Beicheng was even worse than that in Sheng City. At the very least, there was a house under her name in Sheng City. It could be said that Huo Zheng was the only one in her heart.\nAfter filling herself up with snacks and desserts, Lin Xiaowan went to bed. She tossed and turned for a long time but she could not fall asleep. In the end, she found a critically-acclaimed foreign movie to watch.\nHalfway through the movie, her phone rang.\nLin Xiaowan usually did not answer calls from unfamiliar numbers, but this number was from Beicheng. An ominous feeling rose in her heart immediately as she tentatively answered the call. She heard the tired voice of a woman. She knew immediately that the other person was Lin Mei, her aunt.\n\u201cLin Xiaowan, come back. Your father won\u2019t be able to hold on any longer.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan was not shocked. She calmly changed her clothes and went out.\n\u2026\nPerhaps it was late at night so Huo Zheng\u2019s men let down their guard; they did not notice that she had gone out. No one stopped her as she hailed a cab. She bought a train ticket online and easily collected it when she arrived at the train station. No one stopped her at all. For a moment, she could not help but wonder what Huo Zheng meant by \u2018protection\u2019.\nThe train was slated to arrive at 2.15 AM. There was still more than half an hour left so Lin Xiaowan continued to watch the unfinished movie on her phone. However, her eyes might be trained on the screen, but her thoughts had already drifted away to the past.\nA long time ago, she looked forward to the lunar new year. To be precise, she looked forward to the first seven days of the lunar new year. This was because her stepmother would bring her daughter back to her parent\u2019s house during those days, and Lin Xiaowan would have time alone with her father. However, later on, she realized that her father did not care about her at all. Thanks to her disappointment, she gradually lost all expectations.\nThinking about it, she had not seen her father for many years.\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

For a moment, she could not help but wonder what Huo Zheng meant by \u2018protection\u2019.\nThe train was slated to arrive at 2.15 AM. There was still more than half an hour left so Lin Xiaowan continued to watch the unfinished movie on her phone. However, her eyes might be trained on the screen, but her thoughts had already drifted away to the past.\nA long time ago, she looked forward to the lunar new year. To be precise, she looked forward to the first seven days of the lunar new year. This was because her stepmother would bring her daughter back to her parent\u2019s house during those days, and Lin Xiaowan would have time alone with her father. However, later on, she realized that her father did not care about her at all. Thanks to her disappointment, she gradually lost all expectations.\nThinking about it, she had not seen her father for many years.\n\u2026\nIt took five hours for the train to reach Beicheng. Lin Xiaowan had bought the ticket for the fastest train available.\nAfter getting off the train, she received a call from Huo Zheng.\nAlthough Huo Zheng tried his best to suppress his anger, he still sounded fierce when he asked, \u201cLin Xiaowan, where did you go?!\u201d\nLin Xiaowan was taken aback. Huo Zheng had never addressed her by her full name before.\nShe thought about her previous life. During this time in her previous life, Huo Zheng was away on a business trip for two or three days. When he returned, she had also already returned from her hometown. Although he knew about it, he did not ask any questions since he saw that she did not want to talk about it.\nLin Xiaowan followed the crowd to the exit and queued for a cab.\nOn the other end of the line, Huo Zheng took a deep breath. In the morning, when the servants went to deliver food, they had said that no one opened the door. After waiting for a long time, they used the spare key to enter the house and discovered that the house was empty. What was laughable was that the two people he sent to watch over Lin Xiaowan did not even know she was gone.\nThis was the first time Huo Zheng could not control his anger when faced with Lin Xiaowan. He had always been cold and harsh to outsiders. Everyone knew that about the Second Young Master of the Huo family. However, when he faced Lin Xiaowan, he would inadvertently soften.\n\nAt this moment, Huo Zheng, who had never raised his voice at Lin Xiaowan before, could not control himself when he found out that she had gone to Beicheng without a word. He was anxious and angry.\n\u201cI told you not to leave. Why didn\u2019t you listen? It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t allow you to go back. All I asked for is for you to wait. Why can\u2019t you wait?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan\u2019s mind went blank when Huo Zheng raised his voice. She suddenly felt a little fed up. Before she could think more about it, she had already ended the call.\nThe phone was silent for two seconds before Huo Zheng called again.\nLin Xiaowan decisively switched off her phone.\n\u2026\nHuo Zheng was so furious that he threw his phone on the ground. His expression was extremely terrifying at this moment.\nThe Huo family\u2019s bodyguards in charge of protecting Lin Xiaowan lowered their heads and did not dare to breathe loudly. Although the heater was turned on in the room, they felt chills running up their spines. They did not dare to explain themselves. After all, there was no doubt that it was indeed a dereliction of duty on their part. They had watched Lin Xiaowan for a long time now and knew that she did not go out other than to take the trash out. They did not expect her to suddenly leave in the middle of the night.\nHuo Cheng, who was dressed in a formal traditional metal-gray Shangxia suit, patted Huo Zheng\u2019s back and said, \u201cDon\u2019t be too worried. You\u2019ll be able to close the net very soon. Have more confidence in yourself. It\u2019ll be fine soon. It\u2019s not a bad idea for her to leave Sheng City so you don\u2019t have to worry about her being pulled into the chaos here.\u201d\nHuo Zheng rubbed his temples and remained silent.\nAt this time, Huo Cheng\u2019s secretary knocked on the door and entered the room. He did not say too much and only told Huo Cheng that it was time to leave. The election was about to begin.\nHuo Cheng rose to his feet and said, \u201cHold on a little longer. When the cabinet meeting ends today, the Dong family will soon disappear.\u201d\nThe Dong family had always been the Huo family\u2019s enemy. The mastermind behind Song Zhiyi was none other than the current head of the Dong family. The two Huo brothers had carefully set up the chess pieces. For three months and seventeen days, they had been careful as though they were walking on thin ice. Finally, they were ready to close the net.\nAfter Huo Cheng left, Huo Zheng sat in silence for a long time. Then, he called his assistant in and told his assistant to buy him a new phone.\nHuo Zheng glanced at the two bodyguards in the room, who did not dare to speak or move, and said, \u201cScram! Look for her in Beicheng.\u201d\nThe bodyguards scurried away after receiving the order. When they finally left Huo Zheng\u2019s sight, they lamented out loud. Although Beicheng was a small city, looking for someone without an address or clue would be like looking for a needle in a haystack. Alas, they were the ones who made a mistake. No matter how sad they were, they could only bite the bullet.\n\n\u2026\nLin Xiaowan took a cab back to her house in Beicheng. It was her grandmother\u2019s house. Ever since she left for university in Sheng City and changed her household register, there was no room for her there. Her grandmother had converted her room into a storage room.\nLin Xiaowan learned that her father had a cerebral hemorrhage.\nIn the morning, he had bent down to put on his shoes, but when he got up, he suddenly stumbled and fell to the ground. His daughter was home at the time. She was so frightened that she kneeled next to him for a long time, calling out to him before she finally remembered to call the emergency number.\nLin Xiaowan\u2019s grandmother\u2019s house was located in a very old neighborhood. Most people living in the neighborhood were the elderly. They did not have many hobbies and usually gathered in groups of two or three to chat.\nLin Xiaowan hated this place.\nIt was still early in the morning when Lin Xiaowan arrived. There were already many old ladies gathered near the house. When they saw her, they fell silent and stared at her with their turbid eyes as though they were staring at something unusual.\nLin Xiaowan walked past them expressionlessly. She was already annoyed and frustrated as soon as she arrived.\nIt did not take long before the old ladies began to chat among themselves again.\nWhen Lin Xiaowan heard her name, a rare hint of hostility flashed in her eyes.\nThe atmosphere in the house was somber. There were not many people, only her aunt and her family, her grandmother, her stepmother, and her half-sister. No one spoke to her, and she did not want to speak to them either. She stood at the side casually and allowed her thoughts to wander.\nThere was no change in her grandmother\u2019s house at all. The scribbles she had drawn on the wall when she was young were still there. The romance novels she had bought in middle school were still kept under the glass coffee table. The cabinet behind the television still housed the model of a courtyard she built, but it was already covered in dust. Many things that she did not take away were still here.\nLin Xiaowan\u2019s grandmother looked miserable as she cried, \u201cMy son! How could he leave just like that? How am I supposed to leave? Just let me die! My life is so bitter! My son!\u201d\nLin Xiaowan\u2019s aunt held Grandma Lin\u2019s hand, crying as she comforted her heartbroken mother.\nMeanwhile, Lin Xiaowan\u2019s gaze fell on the girl sitting on the couch in the living room. The other party was her half-sister. Her half-sister was 12 years old; 11 years younger than her. Her skin was fair, and her eyes were like black gems. Her thick hair was pulled up into a ponytail. Although she was very young, one could see that she would grow up into a beautiful woman in the future.\nLin Xiaowan looked away. She did not expect that when she finally saw her father again, he would be lying in a coffin.\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

Many relatives, whom Lin Xiaowan had never met before, came and went.\nAs the eldest daughter, Lin Xiaowan had to kneel to observe filial piety. Everyone was crying, but she did not shed a tear at all. Moreover, she felt the others were too noisy. Her aunt came over and said it was inappropriate that she did not cry. A few relatives, whom she was not familiar with, also came over and held her hand as though they were very familiar with her. They cried and told her how much her father loved and missed her, hoping she would cry after listening to their words. However, her expression remained cold as she kneeled silently.\nLin Xiaowan\u2019s left knee was weak. She could not even go mountain hiking since it would aggravate her condition. It was November now so it was extremely cold. Even if she wore two pairs of thick pants, her legs were still stiff and painful from the cold, especially after kneeling for such a long time. If she moved even a little, her left knee would feel as though it was being stabbed by needles.\nWhen it was finally time to leave the ancestral grave, it was already at night. Lin Xiaowan limped into her aunt\u2019s car to return to Beicheng.\nWhen they were in the car, Lin Xiaowan\u2019s aunt gritted her teeth and scolded, \u201cYou\u2019re already an adult so I really don\u2019t want to say anything. However, how could you act like that? Your father is gone, but you didn\u2019t even cry! Look at your sister! She\u2019s so young, but she knows how to cry. Have you forgotten about your father after being away for a few years?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan\u2019s aunt continued to scold, \u201cWhen our relatives spoke to you, you didn\u2019t even greet them. Why are you so rude? I really don\u2019t know what you learned in school. Why are you showing such a bad expression? Your biological father is dead!\u201d\nLin Xiaowan remained expressionless. She had heard these words countless times in her previous life and had long grown tired of them. She leaned her forehead against the window.\nThe night was as dark as ink. The streetlights and a few occasional cars sped past outside the window.\n\u2018Perhaps, I\u2019m really an ingrate\u2026\u2019 Lin Xiaowan thought to herself. She did not have any feelings for her parents at all. She was like this when her mother died as well. It was as though she was born without any sense of kinship. Even in her previous life when she died, she did not spare any thought for her family at all. She only wondered why Huo Zheng cheated on her and why he abandoned her.\n\u2026\nLin Xiaowan asked her to stay for seven days for the funeral rites, but Lin Xiaowan shook her head. Then, she went around to look for a house. Her search was rather fruitful. She found a place with two rooms for 750 yuan a month.\nThe landlady was rather easygoing and easy to talk to; she told Lin Xiaowan that she only needed to pay a small deposit to start renting the house.\n\nLin Xiaowan did not agree immediately. After all, she still wanted to return to Sheng City to find Huo Zheng. After all, Huo Zheng had promised to cut off all contact with Song Zhiyi once the matter was over. She also wanted to hear about everything once the dust had settled.\nSince Lin Xiaowan planned to leave, she had to buy another ticket. She had just brought her phone out to buy the ticket when she saw a notification for the trending news. It was news regarding Huo Zheng and Song Zhiyi.\n[Breaking News! Real-life Cinderella! It\u2019s suspected that there\u2019ll be a happy occasion in the prominent Huo family soon, and an insider revealed that the bride isn\u2019t from a prominent family!]\nThere were many headlines and news similar to this one.\nThe accompanying pictures were blurry, and only one out of nine pictures showed half of Huo Zheng\u2019s face. Although it only showed a small part of his face, Lin Xiaowan could still see his high nose bridge and jaw.\nSong Zhiyi stood next to Huo Zheng. She wore an orange winter coat with a white fur collar. She leaned against him, looking frail and innocent.\nLin Xiaowan clicked on the post with the most comments, which was also the one that broke the news. It had not been long since the post was published, but there were already more than 30,000 comments. Most of them were congratulatory and envious messages. A few people even commented that they could tell the man in the pictures was handsome even if the pictures were blurry.\n[Damn, I can tell he\u2019s handsome based on his side profile. He should be the younger Huo brother, right? I remember that the older brother got married a while ago.]\n[Yes. I remember the older brother even announced that his wife gave birth safely quite a few years ago.]\n[One of them is a high-ranking official in Shangxia while the other is a successful businessman. Whoever is able to marry into the family will definitely enjoy a lifetime of happiness.]\n[Amazing! The Huo family doesn\u2019t need business marriages with their status. This must be true love!]\n[No one would dare to publish such news if it wasn\u2019t true. What if they\u2019re sued for spreading rumors? This also showed that this news is true!]\nAfter reading a few comments, Lin Xiaowan thought about her previous life again. She recalled watching Huo Zheng put on a ring for Song Zhiyi from afar. In this life, she watched him do so through the phone screen.\n\u2018It seems like he lied to me again\u2026\u2019\n\nLin Xiaowan lowered her head to hide her red eyes. She had already experienced it once in her previous life. God even gave her a second chance. Logically, she should have run far away from Huo Zhen. She should not have listened to him no matter what he said and severed all ties with him. Alas, she was weak and could not bear to part with the warmth and care he gave her.\nShe still remembered clearly that after she met Huo Zheng for the first time, the weather changed suddenly at the end of her shift at the amusement park. Dark clouds suddenly rolled in as thunder began to ring the air, heralding the arrival of a storm. However, she did not think too much of it; she was already used to being drenched in the rain since she was young.\nAt that time, she suddenly received a call from Huo Zheng. He only said that it was going to rain soon and told her not to leave yet. He told her to wait for someone to pick her up.\nSince that day, Huo Zheng never let her get drenched in the rain again. He was the only one who worried about her not having an umbrella when it was raining. There were many other small trivial things like that in their relationship.\nFor example, Lin Xiaowan did not like Sichuan pepper. Whether it was raw or cooked, she could not eat it. She had dinner once with Huo Zheng, and he quickly noticed it. He did not say anything at that time, but there had never been any Sichuan pepper in their food since then.\nThrough these seemingly trivial things, Lin Xiaowan\u2019s feelings for Huo Zheng gradually deepened. She became extremely dependent on him and began to obey his every word. Since he cared so much about her, even if he did not love her, he must have liked her.\nLin Xiaowan lacked love since she was young. It was not surprising that she was happy when she received just a little bit of love.\nUnfortunately, Lin Xiaolin realized that the fondness she assumed he had for her was actually nothing.\nNonetheless, she still bought a ticket back to Sheng City. Her heart was calm when she left Sheng City, but it was filled with confusion and hesitation now that she was returning to Sheng City.\n\u2026\nThe situation in Sheng City was not stable.\nIn the end, the person who became the head of the Office of Military and Political Affairs was the current head of the Qin family, Qin Yanchuan. Qin Yanchuan was previously considered a double agent; he was on good terms with the Dong family on the surface, but he was actually on the Huo family\u2019s side.\nShe still bought a ticket back to Shengjing. When she came, her heart was empty, but when she went back, her heart was filled with hesitation and confusion.\nHe might not love her, but why did he lie to her?\nAt this moment, Shengjing Sect did not seem to be stable.\nIn the end, the person who became the head of the Cabinet\u2019s Military and Political Affairs Office was the current head of the Qin family, Qin Yanchuan. Qin Yanchuan was previously considered a double agent. He had always been on good terms with the Dong family, but he was actually on the Huo family\u2019s side in private.\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly. Thank you so much!\n\n", "16": "https://novellive.com/book/becoming-a-wealthy-familys-beloved-after-her-rebirth/chapter-16\n\nDuring the meeting, Qin Yanchuan led a group of people to the Office of Military and Political Affairs and protected Huo Cheng, the chief assistant of the office.\nCompared to the Huo family that had muddy beginnings, the Dong family was like a pool of dirty water. The family members all had ulterior motives, and none of their hands were clean. As soon as the meeting ended, the Dong family immediately had internal conflicts.\nIn fact, Dong Xianghang knew that he had been schemed against as soon as Qin Yanchuan was elected as the head of the family. Seeing the chaos in the Dong family, he knew that he would be finished if the dirty things in his family were exposed. Hence, he quickly gathered his trusted aides and took action, hoping to pull the rig out from under his opponents. He held a copy of the Huo family\u2019s account books; the original was with Song Zhiyi. Alas, he did not expect the Huo family and the Qin family to act before he could submit the evidence in his hand. He had urgently contacted Song Zhiyi then, urging her to send the evidence in her hand to the Prime Minister. However, he could not get in touch with her.\nDong Xianghang could not help but curse.\n\u2018That damn woman was afraid I\u2019d destroy the Huo family so the copy she gave me only contained less serious evidence. She thinks she can marry Huo Zheng with this\u2026\u2019\nDong Xianghang was filled with regrets at this moment.\n\u2018I should\u2019ve known that the b*tch was unreliable. After all, she wants Huo Zheng\u2026\u2019\nDong Xianghang had escaped in the chaos after being dealt a heavy blow. At this time, he was sitting in a black car, crossing the border of Sheng City when he suddenly saw Song Zhiyi, who seemed to be waiting for something by the roadside.\nDong Xianghang quickly got out of the car and slapped Song Zhiyi.\n\u201cYou stinky b*tch! Where\u2019s the original copy of the evidence? I contacted you, but you intentionally cut off contact with me, right?\u201d Dong Xianghang cursed as he kicked Song Zhiyi a few times.\nSong Zhiyi was stunned. She hugged Dong Xianghang\u2019s leg tightly as she wailed. \u201cNo, no, Brother Dong. I was tricked by Huo Zheng, and the original copy was stolen by him!\u201d\n\u201cTricked? I\u2019ve lost everything now! I was hoping that you could negotiate with the Huo family using the evidence in your hands. Now you\u2019re telling me it\u2019s stolen?!\u201d Dong Xianghang cursed as he kicked Song Zhiyi away, \u201cGet lost!\u201d\nThen, Dong Xianghang brought a gun out and pointed it at Song Zhiyi\u2019s head before he asked, \u201cYou colluded with He Zhong to trick me, right? I\u2019m going to f*cking kill you!\u201d\nSong Zhiyi\u2019s hair was disheveled, and her clothes were torn. All traces of her elegance had vanished at this moment. She was scared out of her wits when she saw the gun. She was like a cornered dog at this moment. Out of desperation, she said, \u201cBrother Dong, Brother Dong, I still have a way!\u201d\nDong Xianghang continued to point the gun at her as he said, \u201cTell me.\u201d\n\u201cH-Huo Zheng has a girlfriend. They had broken up, and she\u2019s not by his side now\u2026\u201d\n\nPreviously, Huo Zheng had coaxed Song Zhiyi into bringing him to her house. While she was distracted, he knocked her unconscious. When she was regaining consciousness, she had heard him on the phone. He seemed to be looking for Lin Xiaowan.\n\u201cThey\u2019ve already broken up. What\u2019s the point of saying this?!\u201d\n\u201cNo! Brother Dong, trust me. The breakup is just a coverup. As long as Lin Xiaowan is in our hands, we can use her as a bargaining chip.\u201d\nDong Xianghang looked at Song Zhiyi skeptically. \u201cThe two of you have been together during this period of time. Everyone knows about it. Since the media even dared to report it, it can\u2019t be false\u2026 Why should I believe you? How do I know you\u2019re not sent by Huo Zheng?\u201d\nSong Zhiyi gritted her teeth upon hearing these words. \u201cHe lied to me. That scumbag played with me!\u201d\nHuo Zheng only wanted to snatch back the evidence in Song Zhiyi\u2019s hands that was detrimental to the Huo family. In order to gain Dong Xianghang\u2019s trust, she told Dong Xianghang everything Huo Zheng had done.\nDong Xianghang raised an eyebrow; his interest was piqued. He asked, \u201cWhat do you plan to do?\u201d\nSong Zhiyi heard that Lin Xiaowan was returning to Sheng City, but she did not know the time.\nHowever, this was a small matter. Although Dong Xianghang had fallen into such a state, he was still much better than ordinary people. Moreover, not many people knew about the conflict between the Dong family and the Huo and Qin families. Dong Xianghang might not be able to show his face in front of prominent families in Shangxia, but he still had many underlings.\nFinally, Dong Xianghang put his gun away and ordered someone to bring Song Zhiyi into the car. They were going to an abandoned farmhouse at the border of Sheng City where Dong Xianghang conducted business that could not see the light of day.\n\u201cDo you have any pictures?\u201d Dong Xianghang asked.\n\u201cYes.\u201d\nSong Zhiyi quickly sent a photo to Dong Xianghang.\nDong Xianghang zoomed in on the picture and said with a sneer, \u201cWhat a pretty girl. Look at you and her. Huo Zheng\u2019s luck with women is really good.\u201d\nDong Xianghang sent the photo to his assistant and said, \u201cPrint this picture and give it to the others. Arrange for them to keep an eye on the airport, train station, and bus station. Whoever manages to catch her will be rewarded with\u2026\u201d\nDong Xianghang paused and gestured with his hand before he said, \u201cTen million.\u201d\n\u201cTell your men to be careful. Huo Zheng is also looking for her,\u201d Song Zhiyi said.\n\nDong Xianghang sneered. At this time, Huo Zheng would not dare to search for someone so openly. After all, Huo Zheng was definitely worried about him finding his weakness. As such, this would give him an advantage over Huo Zheng.\n\u2026\nAfter Dong Xianghang ran away, Huo Zheng and Huo Cheng returned to the family house to discuss the follow-up matters.\nQiao You\u2019an and the Qiao family were also involved in this matter, but she knew very little about the matter. As such, she did not have much to do and was waiting for them at the house. When she saw the two brothers, she quickly ran toward them and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on with the news? Which media outlet is so stupid to post about you and Song Zhiyi?\u201d\n\u201cI arranged for it to happen,\u201d Huo Zheng said, looking exhausted. He had lost a lot of weight in the past few days.\n\u201cAre you crazy?!\u201d Qiao You\u2019an asked in shock.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, honey. It\u2019s fake. Song Zhiyi was too vigilant and guarded the evidence tightly. As such, Second Brother came up with this method,\u201d Huo Cheng said, pulling his soft and fragrant wife into his embrace. Similar to Huo Zheng, he was exhausted.\nHuo Zheng brought his phone out and took a look before he said, \u201cIt\u2019s been removed.\u201d\n\u201cDo you know how big a splash this news caused? People love this kind of news the most! You know it\u2019s fake, but do others know? Does Xiaowan know? I know the Huo family is important, but is there no other way?\u201d Qiao You\u2019an asked. She thought that the two brothers\u2019 actions were ridiculous.\nThe two men did not speak.\nHuo Cheng continued hugging his wife silently. After all, Lin Xiaowan was not his wife, and it was not his place to comment on the matter. Everything depended on Huo Zheng.\nHowever, Huo Zheng did not say anything. He had been quite fierce the last time he had spoken to her. After that, he had not spoken to her again.\nThe two men didn\u2019t speak. Huo Cheng was fine with just hugging his wife. Lin Xiaowan wasn\u2019t his wife, so he couldn\u2019t control her. It all depended on Huo Zheng\u2019s opinion.\nHowever, Huo Zheng did not say anything.\nEver since Huo Zheng called Lin Xiaowan, he couldn\u2019t help but sound a little fierce. After the call was hung up, he hadn\u2019t contacted anyone for two days.\nDong Xianghang was a dangerous man, and he had not been caught. He did not dare to look for Lin Xiaowan openly and could only wait for her to come to him so he could explain himself.\nQiao You\u2019an felt helpless. She knew that Lin Xiaowan had returned to Beicheng and assumed that Lin Xiaowan had run away in anger because of Huo Zheng. She said, \u201cEven if it\u2019s for her good, you can\u2019t behave like this. This isn\u2019t your first time in a relationship. Why didn\u2019t you just take a step back and coax her?\u201d\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly. Thank you so much!\n\n", "17": "https://novellive.com/book/becoming-a-wealthy-familys-beloved-after-her-rebirth/chapter-17\n\nWhen Huo Zheng was with Song Zhiyi, he was someone who would pluck the stars and the moon from the sky for her. He would say sweet words just to her to coax her.\nIt was a good thing that Huo Zheng had matured, but he could not be too reserved in front of his girlfriend.\nQiao You\u2019an recalled the time when she met Lin Xiaowan in the summer. At that time, Lin Xiaowan had looked downcast as she said that Huo Zheng did not seem to like her. She could not help but feel distressed for Lin Xiaowan again when she thought this.\n\u00a0Qiao You\u2019an finally said, \u201cAnyway, the matter is over now. When Xiaowan comes back, you must have a good talk with her. If she\u2019s angry, just bear with it. You were wrong in the first place. Let me know if you need my help.\u201d\nAfter a brief moment, Qiao You\u2019an added, \u201cDon\u2019t always be so secretive. You told her about your previous relationship, right? This time, you have to make things clearer so there won\u2019t be any more misunderstandings.\u201d\nHuo Zheng raised his head and said, \u201cI didn\u2019t tell her anything.\u201d\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t tell her?\u201d\nQiao You\u2019an frowned. She thought about Lin Xiaowan\u2019s words at that time, which clearly indicated that Lin Xiaowan knew Song Zhiyi. She asked, \u201cIf you didn\u2019t tell her, then how did she know Song Zhiyi?\u201d\nHuo Zheng could also sense that something was amiss. He asked, \u201cDidn\u2019t you tell her about it?\u201d\nQiao You\u2019an\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cI didn\u2019t. Why would I tell her about it? Wouldn\u2019t that just make things difficult for the both of you?\u201d\nHuo Cheng looked at the two of them in confusion and asked, \u201cWhat are the both of you talking about?\u201d\nQiao You\u2019an patted her husband\u2019s arm and said, \u201cI\u2019ll tell you in detail tonight.\u201d\nHer woman\u2019s intuition was telling her something was wrong. Then, she and Huo Zheng began to analyze the conversations they had with Lin Xiaowan at that time. The more they spoke, the deeper their frowns became.\n\u2026\nAfter Dong Xianghang settled down in the abandoned farmhouse, his assistant rushed over and whispered to him, \u201cBoss, we found her.\u201d\nOnly two hours had passed since Dong Xianghang ordered his men to find Lin Xiaowan.\n\u201cSo fast? Where is she?\u201d\n\u201cWe found her at the train station north of Sheng City.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo one noticed anything, right?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\n\u2026\nLin Xiaowan was jolted awake by some movements. As soon as she regained consciousness, the excruciating pain from the back of her head assaulted her, causing her to feel dizzy. She could hear faint voices talking next to her.\nAt this time, someone casually tossed Lin Xiaowan to the ground. She was already injured at the back of her head. When she hit the ground, she could not help but cry out in pain. She tried to move but discovered that her hands and legs were retrained by hemp ropes.\n\u201cOh, you\u2019re awake?\u201d\nThe man who tossed Lin Xiaowan to the ground walked over and sized her up. When he saw the frown on her face and the beads of sweat on her forehead, he let out a whistle and said lecherously, \u201cYour skin is so fair and tender. It\u2019s soft and smooth as well\u2026\u201d\nLin Xiaowan shrank back in fear.\nFortunately, the man did not do anything else. He only said, \u201cAlright, stop moving around. It won\u2019t be easy for me to explain myself to the boss if something happens.\u201d\n\u2018I\u2019ve been kidnapped\u2026\u2019\nThis was Lin Xiaowan\u2019s first thought.\n\u2018But why?\u2019\nLin Xiaowan tried her best to recall what had happened.\nShe remembered walking out of the train station. There was no fixed taxi stand so she walked around, trying to hail a cab. At that time, someone called out to her from behind. When she turned around, she saw her uncle waving at her from a distance.\nEver since Lin Xiaowan\u2019s mother passed away when she was in high school, she had not seen her uncle again. Although years had passed, he did not seem to change at all. Since they bumped into each other, she went over to greet him. At that time, her uncle said that he had already called for a cab and suggested that they share a cab. However, not long after that, he suddenly said that he had left something at the train station. He pointed to a place and told her to wait for him there before he hurried away. Soon after that, she was knocked unconscious.\n\u2018Who was it?\u2019\nLin Xiaowan only felt her head ache when she tried to think about this matter.\nShe did not know anyone in Sheng City except for Huo Zheng and his family. She did not have any good friends from university as well. She really could not figure out who would want to kill her.\nIt was no winter. During winter in Sheng City, the temperature could drop to as low as -10 degrees Celsius. Unsurprisingly, there was no heater in the abandoned farmhouse.\n\nThis was a nightmare for Lin Xiaowan who was tied up and lying on the ground. The chill from the cement floor passed through her thick clothes, freezing her. Due to the cold, one would become more sleepy. However, sleeping would only make one colder. To make matters worse, she could not move at all. Coupled with the excruciating pain, there were many times when she almost lost consciousness.\nWho knew how much time had passed when the old wooden door suddenly creaked open.\nSong Zhiyi, who was bundled up warmly, followed Dong Xianghang in as she complained, \u201cWhy is it so cold in here?\u201d\n\u201cWhy are you so delicate?\u201d Dong Xianghang asked. He looked at Song Zhiyi\u2019s pouty lips and licked his lips. She was rather experienced in bed, arousing his interest. As such, he treated her much better than before.\nDong Xianghang shifted his gaze to Lin Xiaowan who was lying on the floor and said to his subordinate, \u201cGo find a stove and bring some coals over. It won\u2019t be easy for me to negotiate if she freezes to death.\u201d\nDong Xianghang crouched down to check on Lin Xiaowan\u2019s condition as he asked his assistant casually, \u201cHave you made the call?\u201d\n\u201cYes. I\u2019ve already made the call, and Huo Zheng has already received the news. He said as long as we don\u2019t touch Lin Xiaowan, everything can be discussed,\u201d the assistant replied.\nDong Xianghang nodded. When he felt the huge bump on the back of Lin Xiaowan\u2019s head, he pressed it with twisted curiosity. Then, he said, \u201cSuch a huge bump. Be careful you don\u2019t beat her silly.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan was quickly awakened by the pain when Dong Xianghang pressed the bump on the back of her head. She groaned in pain as she struggled to open her eyes. She did not recognize Dong Xianghang who was crouching in front of her, but she recognized the woman standing behind Dong Xianghang and looking down at her.\n\u201cIt\u2019s you\u2026\u201d Lin Xiaowan looked at Song Zhiyi in disgust.\nDong Xianghang looked at Lin Xiaowan before he looked at Song Zhiyi. \u201cOh, Huo Zheng\u2019s new love and old love know each other?\u201d\nDong Xianghang, who had yet to remove his hand from the back of Lin Xiaowan\u2019s head, touched the bump again. He clicked his tongue and said, \u201cYour uncle is really ruthless. He\u2019s really not worried about killing you at all\u2026\u201d\n\u201cMy\u2026 uncle?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan could not wrap her head around these words for a moment.\nSong Zhiyi laughed mockingly. \u201cThat\u2019s right. For ten million, your uncle betrayed you.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan\u2019s heart sank, but she was not very sad. She did not have any feelings for her uncle. After all, she did not have much contact with him when she was young and even more so after she had grown up.\nAt this time, Lin Xiaowan was more focused on Huo Zheng. They had mentioned him earlier. Based on their words, she could guess that she had probably caused trouble for Huo Zheng.\nDong Xianghang rose to his feet and said to his assistant, \u201cTake a few photos of her and send them to Second Young Master Huo. Make sure she looks miserable.\u201d\nHowever, before the assistant brought his phone out, Song Zhiyi said in a gentle voice, \u201cNo matter how you take the photo, it won\u2019t look that miserable\u2026\u201d\nDong Xianghang raised an eyebrow and asked, \u201cWhat bad ideas do you have now?\u201d\nSong Zhiyi poked Dong Xianghang\u2019s chest with her slender finger and said, \u201cWhat do you mean by bad ideas?\u201d She smiled sweetly before she continued to say, \u201cDon\u2019t you mean good ideas?\u201d\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

I met her in the summer. Her waist was extremely slender, and her legs were very long. Young Master Dong\u2026\u201d\nSong Zhiyi slid her hand down Dong Xianghang\u2019s chest before she continued to say, \u201cDon\u2019t you want to have a taste of both of Huo Zheng\u2019s women?\u201d\nDong Xianghang\u2019s triangular eyes flashed before he laughed. Then, he sized Lin Xiaowan up as though she was some kind of goods and said, \u201cYour words are rather tempting. What about it? Should I taste the both of you at the same time?\u201d\n\u201cIf that\u2019s what Young Master Dong wants, of course, I\u2019ll be willing,\u201d Song Zhiyi said, \u201cWhen we\u2019re done, we can send the photos to Huo Zheng. Do you think he\u2019ll be able to sit still at that time?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan was not inexperienced or innocent. She naturally knew what the two of them were talking about. Terror overwhelmed her heart, but she pretended to be calm as she glared at the two people in front of her. At this time, she also roughly understood why Huo Zheng had sent people to keep an eye on her. As it turned out, she had really misunderstood him. He was not deliberately trying to monitor her movements.\nDong Xianghang laughed and patted Song Zhiyi\u2019s butt. \u201cAlright, stop trying to trick me. As soon as she opened her eyes, I already knew the two of you don\u2019t get along. There\u2019s no need to pretend like you\u2019re trying to help me. You might as well be honest and say that you don\u2019t want her to live well.\u201d\nDong Xianghang was not a lecherous man. Based on Huo Zheng\u2019s attitude, it was clear that Lin Xiaowan was of great importance. If he really did something to Lin Xiaowan, there was a chance that Huo Zheng might abandon Lin Xiaowan. At that time, he would lose his bargaining chip. He naturally would not take such risks.\n\u201cHowever, what you said makes sense. It\u2019ll be hard to make her look miserable in photos\u2026\u201d\nAt this time, his subordinate had already brought the stove and coals in so the temperature in the room had risen slightly.\nDong Xianghang had no interest in staying any longer. He said, giving all authority to Song Zhiyi, \u201cYou can play with her.\u201d\nDong Xianghang raised his chin and gestured at his assistant before he continued to say, \u201cDon\u2019t go too far. He\u2019ll be watching you.\u201d\nThen, he turned to say to his assistant, \u201cWhen she\u2019s done, take some photos and send them to Huo Zheng.\u201d\n\u201cYes, Boss,\u201d the assistant replied with a nod.\nLin Xiaowan glared at Song Zhiyi. No matter how afraid she was, she refused to let it show. She did not want to show her fear in front of Song Zhiyi.\nSong Zhiyi said, \u201cYour eyes are so bright. I feel annoyed just looking at them\u2026\u201d\n\nFollowing that, Song Zhiyi grabbed a fistful of Lin Xiaowan\u2019s hair and pulled her up from the ground before she continued to say, \u201cWhy does Brother Huo like you? He clearly said that he\u2019d love me forever and marry me. You\u2019re the third party who destroyed another person\u2019s relationship.\u201d\nA sharp pain spread through Lin Xiaowan immediately. She suppressed the cry of pain that threatened to spill out of her mouth before she said, \u201cBullsh*t! Huo Zheng stopped loving you a long time ago. You\u2019ve broken up for so many years.\u201d\nAlthough Lin Xiaowan was not eloquent, her aura was not weak at all.\nSong Zhiyi chuckled and whispered into Lin Xiaowan\u2019s ear, \u201cDidn\u2019t you read the news? Huo Zheng and I are getting married.\u201d\nSong Zhiyi deliberately said this to stimulate Lin Xiaowan. She was fooled by Huo Zheng, and she would not let Lin Xiaowan have an easy time either.\nThose words greatly agitated Lin Xiaowan. She did not say a word, but her eyes burned with flames of fury and hatred as she glared at Song Zhiyi.\nSong Zhiyi raised her hand high as she said, \u201cI said earlier that I really hate your eyes!\u201d\n\u2026\nWhen Lin Xiaowan regained consciousness again, she had already been moved to a different place. From what she could tell, she was likely in a cellar.\nThere were no windows, and the room was relatively warm. A small yellow light bulb hung in the corner of a room.\nSong Zhiyi sat on a leather couch, filing her sharp nails.\nLin Xiaowan\u2019s throat was burning. She could not help but cough a few times. Her entire body shook in pain when she coughed. She must have been injured somewhere. Her breathing was not very smooth.\nLin Xiaowan\u2019s fair neck was riddled with terrifying bruises, and a huge bruise could be seen on her forehead. Her left eye was bloodshot, making her look terrifying.\nSong Zhiyi slowly rose to her feet, looking elegant and beautiful. She even had light makeup on. It was a huge contrast to Lin Xiaowan. She took a few steps forward and fiddled with the projector in front of her as she said lightly, \u201cHuo Zheng doesn\u2019t seem to have any intention of saving you. Lin Xiaowan, it\u2019s been almost two days, but there\u2019s no movement at all.\u201d\nSong Zhiyi paused for a moment before she added in a cheerful tone, \u201cHowever, that\u2019s not surprising. After all, I\u2019ll be marrying him. What does it matter if his ex-girlfriend lives or dies? It\u2019s good that he didn\u2019t come. Otherwise, he\u2019d find out that I lied to him.\u201d\nSong Zhiyi\u2019s tone suddenly turned dark as she said, \u201cIf he comes, I\u2019ll make sure he dies here together with me. Who asked him to go back on his words after saying that he\u2019d marry me?\u201d\n\nLin Xiaowan remained silent. Her head, legs, waist, and abdomen were hurting. Song Zhiyi\u2019s voice sounded muffled in her ears. Apart from the sound of her own heaving breathing, everything sounded distant to her at this moment.\n\u201cLet me show you something good,\u201d Song Zhiyi said as she walked toward the weak woman in the corner and dragged her roughly toward the projector.\nLin Xiaowan did not have any strength left to struggle and could only allow Song Zhiyi to do as she pleased.\nSong Zhiyi looked at Lin Xiaowan and suddenly laughed. \u201cYou look like the little kitten I used to play with. It was just like you. It lay half-dead on the ground, meowing at me. I stepped on it with my high heels just like this\u2026\u201d\nSong Zhiyi lifted her foot and brought it down on Lin Xiaowan\u2019s abdomen a few times before she said, \u201cThen, it meowed even more miserably.\u201d\nSong Zhiyi had taken off Lin Xiaowan\u2019s coat. At this time, she was only wearing a dirty white woolen sweater that covered her body.\nSong Zhiyi\u2019s sadistic heart thumped in pleasure when she heard Lin Xiaowan groaning in pain. She said with a regretful tone, \u201cIf only you could meow.\u201d\nThen, Song Zhiyi played a video.\nThe unspeakable and ambiguous sound of heaving breathing filled the small room immediately.\nThe video showed the figures of two people intertwined in bed. The male protagonist was none other than Huo Zheng. It was a video of him and Song Zhiyi.\nLin Xiaowan\u2019s eyes widened in shock. She shook her head in disbelief. \u201cI-Impossible\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWhy is it impossible? Aren\u2019t you seeing it with your own eyes now?\u201d Song Zhiyi said with a sneer, \u201cSince we\u2019re getting married, isn\u2019t this normal? We\u2019re both adults. Take a good look at reality.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan closed her eyes. She could not look, but she could not block out the sounds.\nSong Zhiyi locked Lin Xiaowan in the room. She did not know how much time had passed and could only hear the disgusting and lewd sounds over and over again. Even when she closed her eyes, Huo Zheng\u2019s face would appear in her mind. She tried to convince herself that everything was fake, but she could not help but believe Song Zhiyi. The conflict in her heart only intensified her pain and sorrow.\n\u2026\nDong Xianghang had set the meeting place for the location at an abandoned factory, which was quite a distance away from the abandoned farmhouse. When he saw that only Huo Cheng appeared, he immediately felt that something was wrong.\n\u201cWhy is it only you? Why didn\u2019t Huo Zheng come?\u201d Dong Xianghang asked as he raised the gun in his hand just to be safe.\nHuo Cheng looked relaxed and at ease. He said lightly, \u201cWhat you want is fame and status in the political world. What does it have to do with Huo Zheng?\u201d Then, he tapped the table and said, \u201cSit.\u201d\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly. Thank you so much!\n\n", "19": "https://novellive.com/book/becoming-a-wealthy-familys-beloved-after-her-rebirth/chapter-19\n\nDong Xianghang sized Huo Cheng up with a fierce expression, trying to figure out Huo Cheng\u2019s intentions.\nHuo Cheng shrugged nonchalantly.\n\u2026\nAt this time, Huo Cheng had already brought his men to the abandoned farmhouse where Lin Xiaowan was being held captive. The farmhouse was isolated and seemingly empty. Only upon closer inspection could one see signs of life.\nHuo Zheng did not know where Lin Xiaowan was held. He could not hear any sound. It was too quiet.\nQin Yanchuan, the new Chief of the Office of Military and Political Affairs, had ordered people to surround the farmhouse. He only brought two men with him when he went to Huo Zheng. He whispered, \u201cCheck the back. There shouldn\u2019t be anyone in front and in the granary.\u201d\nHuo Zheng nodded expressionlessly. Since he had yet to find Lin Xiaowan, he did not dare to act recklessly.\nHuo Zheng could not sleep at all over the past few days. Every time he closed his eyes, he would dream of Lin Xiaowan lying in his arms, covered in blood. He would jolt awake, drenched in cold sweat as he recalled the feeling of the cold body in his arms. He felt that the dreams were ominous, and they made him afraid.\nAt this moment, a trusted aide of the Huo family rushed over and said something to Huo Zheng.\nHuo Zheng nodded. He said hoarsely, \u201cTell him to be careful.\u201d\n\u201cOkay.\u201d\nHuo Zheng turned to Qin Yanchuan and said, \u201cDong Xianghang didn\u2019t bring many men with him. The majority is Huo Cheng\u2019s men.\u201d\nDong Xianghang clearly had no intentions of negotiating properly. He only wanted to use Lin Xiaowan as a bargaining chip and was prepared to fight to death.\nAt this moment, Qin Yanchuan\u2019s subordinate said, \u201cChief, it\u2019s confirmed.\u201d\nThe assistant zoomed in on the photo he had just taken and continued to say, \u201cThere are two people in this red house. That woman is there. As for the gray-tiled house next door, there are three people. They\u2019re playing cards. Miss Lin isn\u2019t among these people.\u201d\n\u201cNo?\u201d Qin Yanchuan frowned. Then, he looked at Huo Zheng.\n\u201cImpossible,\u201d Huo Zheng said coldly.\nEarlier, the Huo family told Huo Zheng that Lin Xiaowan was not among the people whom Dong Xianghang brought to the meeting place. Dong Xianghang did not bring any women at all.\n\u201cIs she hidden somewhere?\u201d Qin Yanchuan speculated out loud, \u201cAfter all, Dong Xianghang wants to use her as a bargaining chip. He definitely won\u2019t let us find her so easily.\u201d\nHuo Zheng pointed at Song Zhiyi in the photo and said, \u201cCatch her first. She definitely knows something.\u201d\nQin Yanchuan instructed his men and told them to split up to search the two places. Then, he chuckled and said, \u201cThese people really have low vigilance. Did they think everything would be fine just because they have Dong Xianghang and they\u2019d already kidnapped her?\u201d\n\n\u2026\nWhen the three people in the gray-tiled house saw someone charging in with a gun, they were stunned. The men of the Qin family did not say anything and simply opened fire. Since they could not kill the opponents, they only shot non-vital areas like their arms and legs.\nThe opponents wailed in pain immediately.\nThe thinnest man among the three held his injured leg and rolled to the side. Just as he raised his hand to rise to pull a hanging wire at the side, he was shot again. However, at the critical moment, he managed to pull the wire.\nThe men from the Qin family exchanged a look, feeling that something was amiss. They were worried about explosives. They looked for cover, but after the wire was pulled, there was no violent explosion. They held their guns and looked at the trio who had fainted on the ground before they looked at each other again.\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d\n\u201cWas there a mistake?\u201d\n\u201cWait. Is that a sound coming from the red house?\u201d\nA faint noise rang from the two-story red house nearby, causing the men\u2019s expressions to change drastically. They quickly tied up the trio and left.\n\u2026\nWhen Huo Zheng and Qin Yanchuan barged into the red house, Song Zhiyi and a refined man with half-white hair were eating hotpot. When the man saw them, he reacted quickly and threw the hotpot at the duo before he pulled out the gun at his waist.\nSong Zhiyi\u2019s face turned ashen from fear, and she quickly retreated.\nIt was at this moment that the trio in the gray-tiled house triggered the mechanism.\nA pungent white fog immediately filled the house.\nThe sounds of objects shattering rang in the air as the refined man fired two shots at Huo Zheng and Qin Yanchuan before he stumbled to look for the gas mask.\nQin Yanchuan coughed violently as he cursed, \u201cF*ck, what the f*ck? Why\u2019s there poisonous gas in this house?\u201d\nQin Yanchuan hurriedly closed his stinging eyes and relied on his hearing to determine the current situation.\nMeanwhile, Song Zhiyi covered her nose and her mouth. She took advantage of the chaos and hurried down to the wine cellar through a secret door. Then, she quickly put on a gas mask.\nThe poisonous gas also filled the wine cellar.\nLin Xiaowan was coughing violently as she struggled in pain. Blood dripped from the corner of her lips.\n\u2026\nQin Yanchuan heard a set of footsteps quickly disappearing to one side while the other set of footsteps stopped. He quickly yelled, \u201cHuo Zheng, to the left!\u201d\n\nQin Yanchuan inhaled some of the poisonous gas when he spoke, and he felt his throat burn immediately. He quickly shut his mouth while he cursed the sinister Dong Xianghang in his heart.\nHuo Zheng rushed to the refined man\u2019s side and tried to disarm the other party. He gritted his teeth and fought with the other party, but the other party wore a gas mask so he had the advantage.\nAt this time, Qin Yanchuan\u2019s two subordinates rushed in, but they were forced back by the thick white fog. They kept coughing as they retreated.\n\u201cF*ck, what\u2019s this?\u201d\nAt this time, Qin Yanchuan finally managed to put on a gas mask. When he saw Huo Zheng had fallen to a disadvantageous position, he hurried over to help Huo Zheng and held the other party down before he threw a gas mask over to Huo Zheng.\nSubsequently, Huo Zheng grabbed the refined man\u2019s neck, yanked the other party\u2019s gas mask off, and roared, \u201cWhere is she?\u201d\nSong Zhiyi had been in the room earlier, but she had disappeared.\nHuo Zheng was panicking, and he had lost all his composure at this moment. The veins on his arm bulged as he held the refined man\u2019s neck, almost strangling the other party to death.\nThe refined man had heard of the Second Young Master of the Huo family, but he had never met Huo Zheng before. He only worked for Dong Xianghang because of the money and was not blindly loyal. No matter what, his life was the most important. Seeing the killing intent in Huo Zheng\u2019s eyes, he was so frightened that he trembled. He coughed as he struggled to say, \u201cT-there\u2026 There\u2019s a\u2026 secret door next to the\u2026 cabinet\u2026 over there\u2026\u201d\nAfter that, Huo Zheng quickly knocked the other party unconscious.\nQin Yanchuan dragged the refined man outside and tossed him to his subordinates. \u201cKeep an eye on him. Don\u2019t let him run.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Chief.\u201d\nAfter that, Qin Yanchuan returned to the house to help look for Lin Xiaowan. However, he was choked by the poisonous gas in the house as soon as he entered. He rolled his eyes and muttered, \u201cThere\u2019s only one door between this place and outside. Why\u2019s the difference so big?\u201d\n\u2026\nHuo Zheng rushed down the stairs that led to the wine cellar. He quickly saw Lin Xiaowan curled up on the couch. She was coughing in pain, and her body was twitching unnaturally.\nThe cellar was also filled with thick white fog.\nHuo Zheng\u2019s heart tightened as he rushed over to her. He quickly removed his gas mask. Before he put it on for her, he kissed her eyes gently. When he carried her, he did it with utmost care. He did not know her current condition and did not dare to use any force. Although his hands were trembling in fear, he held her firmly in his arms.\n\u201cQingqing,\u201d Huo Zheng whispered into Lin Xiaowan\u2019s ear.\nLin Xiaowan seemed to have heard him. Her body continued to twitch as she said with great difficulty, \u201cYou\u2026 Hurry up\u2026 leave\u2026 Don\u2019t come\u2026\u201d\nEarlier, Song Zhiyi had suddenly come to the cellar. She had untied the rope binding Lin Xiaowan earlier and dragged Lin Xiaowan to the couch when she heard movements.\nAt that time, Lin Xiaowan remembered Song Zhiyi laughing sinisterly as she muttered, \u201cHuo Zheng really came. He really lied to me.\u201d\nAfter that, Song Zhiyi fled somewhere to hide. It was dark in the cellar, and the only light came from the entrance. As such, Lin Xiaowan did not know where Song Zhiyi went.\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

She said anxiously, struggling to speak as her body was racked in pain, \u201cH-hurry up and leave\u2026 S-Song Zhiyi is here\u2026\u201d\nSong Zhiyi was a lunatic. Lin Xiaowan was really worried Song Zhiyi would hurt Huo Zheng. She did not listen to him and left, implicating Huo Zheng as a result. If anything happened to him, she would feel guilty for the rest of her life.\n\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid, Qingqing,\u201d Huo Zheng said as he carried Lin Xiaowan out, \u201cI\u2019ll bring you back.\u201d\nWhen Huo Zheng was carrying Lin Xiaowan up the stairs, Qin Yanchuan, who was standing at the top of the stairs, suddenly raised his gun and pointed in Huo Zheng\u2019s direction. He said in an unfriendly tone, \u201cYou better not act rashly.\u201d\nHuo Zheng froze. Then, he realized that Qin Yanchuan was not looking at him but behind him.\nSong Zhiyi had appeared at some point. She was trembling as she held a small pistol and aimed it at Huo Zheng\u2019s back.\nHuo Zheng, who was carrying Lin Xiaowan, turned to the side and sneered disdainfully.\nSong Zhiyi held the gun with both hands as she looked at him tearfully and said, \u201cIf you take another step with her in your arms, I\u2019ll really shoot you!\u201d\nHuo Zheng ignored Song Zhiyi. All of his attention was on Lin Xiaowan at this moment. Although there was a small heater in the cellar and it was warmer than it was upstairs, Lin Xiaowan\u2019s body was extremely cold.\nLin Xiaowan grabbed Huo Zheng\u2019s shirt. Her eyes were closed as she twitched.\nSeeing that Huo Zheng disregarded her and made his way up the stairs with Lin Xiaowan in his arms, Song Zhiyi cried out, \u201cHuo Zheng!\u201d\nSong Zhiyi\u2019s voice was sharp, and it carried a hint of sorrow. As soon as her voice fell, she fired the gun.\nAlmost at the same time, Qin Yanchuan who saw through Song Zhiyi fired as well, and the bullet hit Song Zhiyi\u2019s hand.\nSong Zhiyi had never learned how to shoot after all. Moreover, her hands were trembling. In the end, the bullet only grazed Huo Zheng\u2019s waist and hit the cement wall.\nHuo Zheng paused briefly in his steps before he walked out with Lin Xiaowan in his arms.\nSong Zhiyi shrieked Huo Zheng\u2019s name, holding her bloody hand.\nQin Yanchuan jumped down and knocked Song Zhiyi out before he grabbed one of her legs to drag her up the stairs. At the same time, he muttered under his breath, \u201cMy wife doesn\u2019t like me touching other women. This is all Huo Zheng\u2019s fault. I hope my wife doesn\u2019t ignore me when I get home.\u201d\n\u2026\n\nWhen Qin Yanchuan\u2019s two subordinates saw Huo Zheng coming out with Lin Xiaowan, they said anxiously, \u201cSecond Young Master Huo, we have to leave as soon as possible. I don\u2019t know why a fire broke out upfront. If we don\u2019t leave now, we\u2019ll be trapped.\u201d\nThe duo covered their mouths and noses as they called out, \u201cChief!\u201d\nQin Yanchuan cursed and said, \u201cBoth of you come here and bring this woman out.\u201d\nIt would have been easier for Qin Yanchuan to carry Song Yizhi out instead of dragging her out, but he was really unwilling to carry her.\nHuo Zheng moved very quickly with Lin Xiaowan in his arms. In the end, he began to run.\nLin Xiaowan was in a terrible state. The injury at the back of her head had worsened over the past two days. When Huo Zheng ran, she bit her lip tightly in pain, too afraid to make a sound. She had heard that there was a fire. She had already caused so much trouble for him, and she did not want to slow him down now. After all, time was of the essence now.\nApart from two or three brick houses in the back of the farm, the other buildings were constructed from wood. As such, the fire spread very quickly.\nThe farm was located in the wilderness, nestled between lush hills. The air in winter was dry and strong, further spreading the fire.\nIt was difficult for the group of people to avoid the fire as they navigated their way out of the sea of flames.\n\u2026\nHuo Zheng only brought one man with him. He had just reported to Huo Cheng that the matter at the farmhouse had been dealt with when he saw the raging fire.\nHe did not dare to drive in recklessly. The houses and trees were burning; he would not be able to see where he was going. Moreover, the car was not fireproof, and if it caught fire, there might even be an explosion. At that time, things would be even more difficult to deal with. As such, he could only wait anxiously and helplessly.\n\u2026\nLin Xiaowan felt her consciousness drifting away, and she dug her nails into her palms to stop herself from fainting. She still had many things to say to Huo Zheng. She could smell burnt wood and hear the sound of Huo Zheng\u2019s heavy breathing.\n\u201cSecond Young Master!\u201d\nWhen the Huo family\u2019s trusted aide saw Huo Zheng rushing out, he quickly leaped out of the car.\n\u201cGet in the car. Let\u2019s go!\u201d Huo Zheng said, not wanting to waste time.\nQin Yanchuan also got into the car. The first thing he did was to call his wife. When he called Gu Yuwu, his wife, his aura changed immediately. He, who was domineering outside, was like a golden retriever wagging its tail when he spoke to his wife.\nHe told Gu Yuwu to contact the nearest Forest Management Department and sent her the location so they could put out the fire.\n\nThe place was too big, and it would be difficult to put out the fire if it grew too big. They had to put it out as soon as possible.\nWhile one of Qin Yanchuan\u2019s men drove the car, Huo Zheng\u2019s trusted aide saw Huo Zheng\u2019s stiff posture and the blood stain on his shirt. He asked in a low voice, \u201cSecond Young Master, there\u2019s a first aid kit in the car. Do you want to bandage your wound?\u201d\nHuo Zheng glanced at him and did not loosen his grip on Lin Xiaowan at all as he said, \u201cSend Madam to the hospital first.\u201d\nWith that, the trusted aide only nodded and no longer dared to interfere.\nLin Xiaowan\u2019s hand kept tugging at Huo Zheng\u2019s shirt. When Huo Zheng held her hand to calm her down, she struggled, trying to break free.\nHuo Zheng, who was always aloof, was very gentle when he lowered his head and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Where do you feel unwell?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan\u2019s breathing was weak; it was difficult for her to breathe. With the gas mask, she felt even more suffocated. She shook her head and cried, \u201cNo, no\u2026 this\u2026\u201d\nSeeing that she was in great pain, Huo Zheng hurriedly helped her remove the mask.\nEvery time Lin Xiaowan drew a breath, her chest ached and her throat burned. She could taste blood in her mouth. She tried to endure it as she coughed and asked, \u201cWhere\u2026 Where are you\u2026 injured?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not injured. Don\u2019t talk. We\u2019re almost at the hospital. Do your eyes hurt? Close your eyes and rest,\u201d Huo Zheng said. His usually charming voice was hoarse at this moment.\nHuo Zheng gently caressed the top of Lin Xiaowan\u2019s bloodshot left eye as he spoke.\nIn fact, they were still quite a distance away from the hospital. The location of the farmhouse was very remote after all. At this time, they had not even left the wilderness.\nLin Xiaowan obediently closed her eyes, but she shook her head and said, \u201cDon\u2019t lie to me.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not lying,\u201d Huo Zheng said before he kissed her gently.\nLin Xiaowan inhaled deeply again. \u201cYou\u2019re injured. You lied to me\u2026\u201d\nTears fell from the corners of her eyes as she coughed again and said, \u201cD-don\u2019t lie to me\u2026\u201d\nHuo Zheng\u2019s heart ached when he saw the state she was in. He kept kissing and comforting her. \u201cIt\u2019s just a scratch. Stop talking, okay?\u201d\nAlthough Lin Xiaowan was already in his arms, he still felt panicked and anxious for some reason.\nTears continued to fall as Lin Xiaowan said, \u201cS-sorry\u2026\u201d\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly. Thank you so much!\n\n", "21": "https://novellive.com/book/becoming-a-wealthy-familys-beloved-after-her-rebirth/chapter-21\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t apologize, Qingqing. Please stop talking, okay? Rest for a while. Be good and listen to me,\u201d Huo Zheng said with a pleading expression.\nLin Xiaowan shook her head. Her emotions agitated, and she suddenly spat out a mouthful of blood. The blood looked particularly stark when it stained Huo Zheng\u2019s shirt.\nHuo Zheng felt as though his heart was going to stop beating at this moment.\nBlood stained the corners of Lin Xiaowan\u2019s lips as she said stubbornly, \u201cI have to apologize. I\u2019m sorry that I misunderstood you. I\u2019m sorry for causing\u2026\u201d\nBefore she could say the word \u2018trouble\u2019, she began to cough violently again. As she coughed, more blood stained Huo Zheng\u2019s shirt. A few drops even landed on his face.\nHuo Zheng felt his mind go blank as he held her. \u201cStop talking. We\u2019re going to the hospital now. Be good.\u201d\nAlthough Lin Xiaowan was crying, she smiled. She did not listen to Huo Zheng and continued to say, \u201cI\u2019m sorry for\u2026 causing you trouble\u2026\u201d\n\u201cStop apologizing. You don\u2019t have to feel sorry,\u201d Huo Zheng said as he hugged her tightly and kissed her gently, \u201cYou\u2019ll be fine once we reach the hospital.\u201d\nThese words were not only meant for Lin Xiaowan, but for himself as well. He did not know what kind of injuries she sustained. His heart was in a mess, but he pretended to be calm on the surface.\n\u201cI\u2026 like you very, very\u2026 much,\u201d Lin Xiaowan said weakly. She held Huo Zheng\u2019s hand with all her might. Both their hands were cold at this moment.\nAt this moment, she thought that she should not have faulted Huo Zheng for not saying he liked her. After all, she had never said she liked him as well.\nHuo Zheng intertwined their fingers together and said, \u201cPlease stop talking. I beg you.\u201d\nAt this moment, he could no longer maintain his composure. \u201cI\u2019m the one who should apologize. Qingqing, bear with it for a while. Don\u2019t talk anymore, okay? We\u2019ll reach the hospital soon.\u201d\n\u201cAre you really going to marry her?\u201d Lin Xiaowan asked. Her voice was barely audible. She really wanted an answer.\n\u201cNo, it was fake. I only want to marry you. Qingqing, I only want to marry you,\u201d Huo Zheng said as he kissed her cheek. His eyes were slightly wet as he continued to say, \u201cWhen you\u2019re better, I\u2019ll tell you everything. I won\u2019t hide anything from you anymore.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay. You did it for me, after all. It\u2019s okay.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan tightened her grip on his hand.\n\nApart from being injured, Huo Zheng had also lost some weight, and he looked exhausted. However, in her eyes, he was still very handsome.\n\u201cI\u2019m really sorry. I shouldn\u2019t have left without a word\u2026\u201d Lin Xiaowan still felt extremely apologetic.\n\u201cIt\u2019s my fault. It\u2019s my fault, Qingqing. Don\u2019t apologize. I should be the one to apologize.\u201d\nMeanwhile, Qin Yanchuan, who had already gotten off the phone with his wife, did not disturb the couple. He only urged his subordinate to drive faster.\nLin Xiaowan squeezed Huo Zheng\u2019s hand. She was very happy that Huo Zheng was still willing to coax her like this. She smiled happily.\nIn Lin Xiaowan\u2019s opinion, she had always caused trouble for others since she was young. She had caused trouble for her parents and her grandparents. She knew no one liked her, and she had always felt redundant. It was only after she graduated and met Huo Zheng, experiencing what it was like to be cared for that she realized how wonderful life could be.\nIt did not matter if Huo Zheng liked her or not. He had treated her so well, but she still threw a tantrum and argued with him. She had caused such a huge trouble, but he did not blame her and also came to save her. Not only that, but he was also willing to lower his head to coax her. It was as though he was sent down from heaven to save her. He was really very good.\n\u2026\nHuo Zheng still did not recover his senses even after Lin Xiaowan was pushed into the emergency room. When Lin Xiaowan suddenly closed her eyes in the car, it felt as though his blood had frozen in his veins. He immediately recalled the ominous dreams he had over the past few days and felt like he was about to suffocate. Fortunately, she was alive.\nHuo Cheng, who had dealt with the matter on his hand, arrived at the hospital soon after. He was shocked by his younger brother\u2019s appearance and quickly stuffed a packet of tissue into his hands as he said, \u201cWipe your tears.\u201d\nHe naturally did not laugh at his younger brother. If Qiao You\u2019an were in Lin Xiaowan\u2019s position, he would have cried more miserably than his brother.\nHuo Cheng could not help but feel a little emotional. It had been a long time since he had seen Huo Zheng cry. It seemed like the last time Huo Zheng cried was when he broke up with Song Zhiyi.\nWhen Huo Zheng recollected himself, Huo Cheng urged him to get himself treated.\nHuo Zheng looked terrible as well. There was a large patch of bloodstain on his waist. There was also blood from Lin Xiaowan on his chest. His shirt was singed, and his hair was covered in dust.\nWhen Huo Zheng returned, he had already changed into a new set of clothes. His expression was unfathomable, returning to the Second Young Master Huo whom everyone knew.\n\u201cHe has been handed over to the Qin family,\u201d Huo Cheng said, \u201cThe Qin family will handle the rest of the matter. Qin Yanchuan contributed greatly in this matter.\u201d\nAmong the people Huo Cheng brought to meet Dong Xianghang were foreigners from Myanmar, and they were all friends of Qin Yanchuan.\nHuo Zheng nodded.\n\n\u201cThe Dong family is crumbling. There are a few projects under him that are okay. You can take over those that are beneficial.\u201d\nHuo Zheng was not in the mood to discuss work now so he did not say anything.\n\u2026\nIt was getting late, but the surgery was not over yet.\nAfter putting her two sons to bed, Qiao You\u2019an called to ask about the situation. Huo Cheng briefly explained the situation to her before he told her to go to sleep and not wait for him.\nAfter Huo Cheng ended the call, Huo Zheng told Huo Cheng to go home first.\nSeeing how anxious Huo Zheng was from waiting, Huo Cheng said, \u201cIf I leave you alone, I\u2019m worried you won\u2019t be able to hold it in and cry again.\u201d\nAt this time, Huo Cheng remembered that Lin Xiaowan was not from Sheng City. Such a terrible thing had happened to her, and he thought that her family should be informed about it. He asked, \u201cDo you have Xiaowan\u2019s family\u2019s number? We should inform her family.\u201d\nHuo Zheng shook his head slowly. Lin Xiaowan had never spoken to him about her family. Since it was a personal matter, he did not take the initiative to investigate it. How could he have her family\u2019s number?\nHuo Cheng rarely asked about his brother\u2019s personal matters. When he saw his brother shaking his head, he asked, surprised, \u201cNo? Aren\u2019t both of you about to get married? Don\u2019t tell me you haven\u2019t even met her parents?\u201d\nIndeed, Huo Zheng had yet to meet Lin Xiaowan\u2019s parents.\nAfter thinking about it, Huo Cheng thought it was not surprising. Usually, both sets of parents would meet. Since their parents had passed away, he, the eldest brother, was the elder. If they met, there was no way Huo Zheng would not tell him.\nAt this time, Huo Cheng recalled what Qian You\u2019an had told him before they went to bed. She had said that Lin Xiaowan thought that Huo Zheng did not like her. He could not help but ask, \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you don\u2019t like Lin Xiaowan?\u201d\nHuo Cheng was already upset that there was no news from the operating theatre. When he heard Huo Cheng\u2019s words, he frowned. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\n\u201cAn\u2019an told me that Lin Xiaowan thinks you don\u2019t like her.\u201d\nHuo Zheng\u2019s frown deepened.\nHuo Cheng said, \u201cActually, I don\u2019t blame her for feeling that way. Sometimes, I even wonder if you like her or only want to find someone to marry.\u201d\nHuo Cheng did not shy away from Huo Zheng\u2019s cold gaze. He did not feel that he said anything wrong.\n\u201cDon\u2019t look at me like that. After all, your current state is too different from before,\u201d Huo Cheng said, \u201cYou only looked a little like your past self when you were so nervous and cried earlier\u2026\u201d\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly. Thank you so much!\n\n", "22": "https://novellive.com/book/becoming-a-wealthy-familys-beloved-after-her-rebirth/chapter-22\n\n\u201cMoreover, our circle isn\u2019t that big. There are only a few aristocratic families here. Everyone knows you have someone by your side, but no one has ever met her before. You never bring Xiaowan along when you attend events. When others try to subtly ask about it, your expression will immediately. You might not have heard the rumors outside, but it doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t exist.\u201d\nHuo Zheng was lost in his thoughts. He had never thought about this before. It was not that he did not want to bring her to various events, but she did not seem willing. Since she was not willing, he naturally would not force her.\nAt this moment, Huo Zheng\u2019s phone rang. The call was from the two bodyguards whom he had sent to Beicheng to look for Lin Xiaowan a few days ago. After Lin Xiaowan had returned, he told them to look into the matter of her return to her hometown. He wanted to know why she suddenly decided to return.\nAfter listening for a moment, a shocked and confused expression appeared on Huo Zheng\u2019s face.\nWhen he ended the call, Huo Cheng asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\nHuo Zheng looked at the concerned Huo Cheng and said, \u201cQingqing returned to attend her father\u2019s funeral.\u201d\n\u201cShe didn\u2019t tell you?\u201d\n\u201cNo\u2026\u201d\nSince the day they met, Lin Xiaowan had never mentioned her father to Huo Zheng. At this time, he recalled how he had lost his temper at her over the phone for the first time when he found out that she had returned to Beicheng. He felt slightly regretful at this moment.\n\u201cYou\u2026\u201d\nHuo Cheng wanted to ask how much Huo Zheng knew about Lin Xiaowan\u2019s family but thought better of it.\n\u2026\nIt was not until the second half of the night that the doctor came out from the operating theater.\nHuo Zheng rose to his feet immediately and clenched his hands nervously.\nThe doctor looked rather relaxed as he said, \u201cThere\u2019s no serious problem. The patient will be sent to the ICU to be observed for 24 hours. If everything goes as expected, she\u2019ll be transferred to the general ward.\u201d\n\u201cCan she be transferred to another hospital?\u201d\nThe hospital they were in was in the suburbs. The environment and resources were not as good as the ones in the city. The doctors, who treated Lin Xiaowan, were also brought here from the hospital in the city, which was owned by the Huo family.\nThe doctor nodded. \u201cYes, but you\u2019ll have to wait 24 hours. We must wait for the patient\u2019s condition to stabilize.\u201d\nThen, he looked at the two Huo brothers and said, \u201cCan I trouble her family member to come with me? I\u2019ll explain the patient\u2019s condition in detail.\u201d\n\nNeedless to say, Huo Zheng went with the doctor.\nThe doctor was from the Huo family\u2019s hospital so he naturally knew who Huo Zheng was.\n\u201cPlease take a seat, Mr. Huo.\u201d\nThe doctor told Huo Zheng about Lin Xiaowan\u2019s head injury before he advised, \u201cIt\u2019s best for the patient to avoid electronic devices for two months. It\u2019s best not to strain the patient\u2019s eyes as it might affect her vision. The broken capillaries in her left eye will heal eventually. The process might be slow, but there\u2019s no need to worry.\u201d\nHuo Zheng felt both relieved and worried. He asked, \u201cWhy were her hands and legs twitching?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s because she inhaled too much gas.\u201d\nThe doctor did not say what gas it was, but Huo Zheng understood his meaning.\n\u201cIn addition, she suffered a serious injury on her head so she was extremely weak. The gas affected her nervous system at the time, causing the twitching. The twitching will disappear after the treatment.\u201d\n\u201cHowever, there are some problems that you need to take note of. The patient\u2019s respiratory system and lung functions have been damaged to a certain extent. This is irreversible. It\u2019s impossible to restore them to their original state.\u201d\nHuo Zheng\u2019s expression darkened upon hearing the doctor\u2019s words, and his aura changed immediately. He looked a little fierce at this moment.\nThe doctor was not intimidated. After all, he understood that Huo Zheng was worried. He said, \u201cMr. Huo, let me finish.\u201d\n\u201cIn the future, take special care when the patient catches a cold or fever, especially when the seasons change. If the patient catches a cold, she might have trouble breathing, especially at night. As a result, it\u2019ll disrupt her sleep. I\u2019m only telling you this as a precaution. There\u2019s no need to panic. Just take the medicine according to my prescription.\u201d\nHuo Zheng nodded, but his expression did not improve.\n\u201cThere\u2019s another thing\u2026\u201d\nThe doctor looked a little hesitant at this moment.\n\u201cThe patient\u2019s uterus suffered external trauma. Although there are ways to increase the chances of getting pregnant, it might be more difficult for her to get pregnant in the future. This doesn\u2019t mean that she\u2019s infertile. The chances of getting pregnant are just lower.\u201d\nHuo Zheng\u2019s heart felt as though it had frozen. He knew Lin Xiaowan liked children very much, but he had always taken precautions. After all, they were not married yet. Moreover, he felt Lin Xiaowan was still young and did not want her to have a child so early. He also did not want a child to disturb their lives so soon. He truly did not expect such a thing to happen.\n\u2026\nDuring the 24 hours of waiting, Huo Zheng received another piece of news that angered him.\nHuo Cheng was afraid that Huo Zheng would act impulsively so he quickly held Huo Zheng down and said, \u201cI\u2019ve already confirmed it. Xiaowan\u2019s uncle was blinded by greed and betrayed her for ten million from Dong Xianghang.\u201d\n\nHuo Cheng sneered. \u201cI\u2019ve already captured him. He took the money and applied for a passport to go abroad. He\u2019s clearly guilty.\u201d\nHuo Zheng closed his eyes, suppressing his urge to kill someone.\n\u2026\nLin Xiaowan had a very, very long dream.\nShe saw her photo in the Huo family\u2019s ancestral hall, and her body was covered in white cloth.\nLin Xiaowan was a little speechless.\n\u2018No way. Did I die so soon after being reborn?\u2019\nShe still remembered leaning against Huo Zheng\u2019s chest in the car; she remembered the temperature of his body. At some point, she fainted.\n\u2018Did I die after I fainted?\u2019\nShe felt a little depressed. She had just told Huo Zheng she liked him, and she wondered how he would react.\nMoreover, people were reborn to lead better lives, right? Why did she die even earlier after she was reborn?\nSoon enough, she saw Huo Zheng walking into the ancestral hall before he closed the door. No one else came in.\nLin Xiaowan approached him and looked at him curiously.\nIt was the first time she had seen him looking so dejected. He was dressed in black, and he looked lifeless as though his wife had passed away.\n\u2018Oh, his wife really died\u2026 Wait, I didn\u2019t marry him in this life\u2026 Then, why am I in the Huo family\u2019s ancestral hall? I\u2019m not a member of the Huo family. How strange.\u2019\nIn the very long dream, Lin Xiaowan watched as Huo Zheng sat quietly in the hall for two days without eating. During this time, Huo Cheng came once, but Huo Zheng ignored him completely. In the end, Huo Cheng had no choice but to leave.\nLin Xiaowan did not quite understand Huo Zheng\u2019s actions, but she really admired his courage. After all, there was a corpse lying in front of him.\nLin Xiaowan took a seat next to Huo Zheng and asked curiously, \u201cAren\u2019t you afraid? I\u2019m dead\u2026\u201d\nShe made a face at him and said, \u201cI\u2019m going to take you away with me!\u201d\nUnexpectedly, Huo Zheng seemed to have sensed something. He turned slightly in her direction and froze as though he had fallen into a trance.\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly. Thank you so much!\n\n", "23": "https://novellive.com/book/becoming-a-wealthy-familys-beloved-after-her-rebirth/chapter-23\n\nLin Xiaowan poked Huo Zheng teasingly. Of course, she could not really poke him and only pretended to. She said, \u201cWhy do you look like you\u2019re going to die?\u201d\nAfter saying that, she hurriedly said, \u201cNo, no, I\u2019m not cursing you to die. You have to live well.\u201d\n\u2026\nOn the morning of the third day, Huo Zheng rose to his feet unsteadily. Perhaps it was because he had been sitting for too long.\nLin Xiaowan said anxiously, \u201cBe careful! What if you faint? No one will know if you faint, and I won\u2019t be able to call for help!\u201d\nHuo Zheng paused for a moment before he slowly walked forward.\nLin Xiaowan continued to chatter next to him.\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you eat? You have to take care of your body. Don\u2019t make things difficult for yourself.\u201d\nSince Huo Zheng could not hear her, there was naturally no response.\nLin Xiaowan pouted. \u201cI hate it when you don\u2019t say anything.\u201d\n\u201cAlso, what\u2019s the point of hiding things from me? Don\u2019t you think I\u2019m unworthy of your trust? I\u2026\u201d\nLin Xiaowan stopped speaking abruptly. Her eyes widened as she stared at Huo Zheng with her mouth agape.\nHuo Zheng had leaned over and kissed the person in the coffin.\n\u201cAre you crazy, Huo Zheng? How dare you kiss a dead person?\u201d Lin Xiaowan looked at him in disbelief.\nHuo Zheng pushed the white cloth aside and tidied her hair and clothes. Then, he held her hands and carefully trimmed her nails.\nSoon, Lin Xiaowan was distracted. She noticed that the her lying in the coffin only had long black hair. Her hair now only passed her shoulder. With this, she was almost certain that the person lying there was her from her previous life after being hit by a car.\n\nLin Xiaowan was terrified. She did not know what was going on. Did she imagine her rebirth to the time before their marriage? Did she truly die after being hit by the car?\n\u2026\nLater on, Lin Xiaowan found that she could not leave Huo Zheng\u2019s side at all. She followed him wherever he went, voluntarily and involuntarily. It was quite strange to see her body turn into ashes kept in a small urn with her own eyes.\nLin Xiaowan followed Huo Zheng to the columbarium. She furrowed her brows slightly when she saw the urn being placed in the columbarium. She had forgotten to tell Huo Zheng that she wanted her ashes to be scattered in the wind. How good would it be to be free?\nShe took another look at the columbarium. It was spacious and luxurious. When she thought about how Huo Zheng\u2019s ashes would also be placed here, she sighed inwardly and thought to herself, \u2018I guess it\u2019s fine for me to wait for him here. At least, he won\u2019t be too lonely when the time comes\u2026\u2019\n\u2026\nInitially, Lin Xiaowan thought that she would disappear now that the funeral rites were over, but she did not. She was still tied to Huo Zheng.\nA few days later, Song Zhiyi appeared at the Huo family house. She was in a sorry state; her hair was disheveled, her face was haggards, and her clothes were torn. She was forced to kneel at the entrance of the house by the bodyguards of the Huo family.\nHuo Zheng did not look at Song Zhiyi as he removed his clothes, revealing a gray scarf.\nThe scarf was the anniversary present that Lin Xiaowan wanted to give Huo Zheng. She was still a few stitches away from completing it. Alas, she died before she had a chance to finish it.\nLin Xiaowan was a little worried about Huo Zheng. She had been by his side over the past few days, and she saw that he barely ate and slept. He would lie in bed for a short while before he woke up again. Then, he would sit on the balcony and silently smoke cigarette after cigarette. He could smoke up to a few packs of cigarettes a night. In the past, he used to smoke occasionally, but he took the initiative to quit after he discovered Lin Xiaowan\u2019s strange habit of smelling cigarette smoke.\nLin Xiaowan did not like seeing him like that. She put her hands on her hips and reprimanded him fiercely. Alas, he could not hear at all.\nAt this moment, Huo Zheng walked over to Song Zhiyi and looked down at her as he said expressionlessly, \u201cI don\u2019t hit women.\u201d\nSong Zhiyi was terrified. Her face was ashen as she begged, \u201cI know my mistake, Huo Zheng. I really know my mistake! I beg you, let me go! Let me go, Huo Zheng, for old times\u2019 sake. We were\u2026\u201d\nBefore Song Zhiyi finished speaking, Huo Zheng suddenly grabbed her neck and said in a low and sinister voice, \u201cIf you dare to mention the past, I\u2019ll end you immediately. I could overlook the fact that you tried to threaten the Huo family, but you actually dared to plot against her!\u201d\nSong Zhiyi was restrained by the bodyguards and could not struggle at all. The veins on his arm bulged as her face turned red and purple. Her eyes looked as though they were going to pop out of their sockets. She was about to be strangled to death.\nUpon seeing this, the butler stepped forward and said, \u201cSecond Young Master, I\u2019m sure Madam wouldn\u2019t want to see you like this.\u201d\n\nHuo Zheng sobered up immediately. He quickly let go of Song Zhiyi as though he had been electrocuted and took a few steps back.\nLin Xiaowan, who was watching from the side, was speechless when she heard the butler\u2019s words.\n\u2018What would you know about what I want? I\u2019m already dead. What do you know about what I want?\u2019\nLin Xiaowan was also confused. Was Song Zhiyi not Huo Zheng\u2019s first love? Why was he so ruthless to Song Zhiyi? What did she miss? Why did the plot develop so differently from what she had imagined?\nApart from confusion, there was also shock. Based on Huo Zheng and Song Zhiyi\u2019s conversation, it was clear that Song Zhiyu played a part in her death. It was not an accident. It was likely that Song Zhiyi had hired someone to hit her with a car.\nLin Xiaowan was furious. She had been slightly confused when she was hit by a car previously. The light had been green when she first crossed the zebra crossing. At that time, she only attributed it to her bad luck and resigned herself to her fate. Who knew it was all orchestrated?\nSpurred by her anger, Lin Xiaowan rushed toward Song Zhiyi. She wanted to punch Song Zhiyi. However, she had only taken two steps when her vision suddenly blurred. She heard a loud clang before everything turned dark.\n\u2026\nA slightly hoarse voice rang in the darkness.\n\u201cBaby, it\u2019s snowing today.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan\u2019s anger returned.\n\u2018Huo Zheng, who the f*ck are you calling \u2018baby\u2019? I\u2019ve never heard you speak to me so gently! Ah, I\u2019m so angry!\u2019\nLin Xiaowan struggled to open her eyes. As soon as she opened her eyes, she was greeted with a face with stubbles. The other party looked at her in surprise.\nLin Xiaowan\u2019s anger erupted, and she shouted, \u201cScumbag!\u201d\nLin Xiaowan thought she had shouted rather loudly, but the truth was she sounded very weak. It took her a lot of effort just to open her eyes earlier.\nNonetheless, the room was very quiet so there was no doubt Huo Zheng had heard her. He froze for a moment, looking at her blankly. Then, he stiffly called the doctor over to check on her.\nAfter the examination was completed, Lin Xiaowan felt more awake. She leaned against the pillow and stared into space, doubting her life.\n\u2018Did I unlock a new scenario? Am I dead or alive?\u2019\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

His hand was warm so she managed to draw some warmth from it.\nIt was really snowing outside like Huo Zheng said. In fact, it was snowing rather heavily.\nHuo Zheng did not speak.\nLin Xiaowan knew that if she did not speak, he would not speak either. Hence, she took the initiative and asked perfunctorily, \u201cWhere am I?\u201d\n\u201cAll Heart Hospital.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan looked around. The room really did not look like the normal hospital ward. It was more like a nice bedroom.\n\u201cWhat month is it now?\u201d Lin Xiaowan asked tentatively, wondering if she had been reborn again.\n\u201cDecember,\u201d Huo Zheng said as he looked at her, \u201cYou were asleep for a long time.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan tried to move. No wonder she felt sore all over. It seemed like she had been lying down for too long. She finally confirmed that she was not reborn again, and she was still in the period where she had yet to marry Huo Zheng.\n\u2018Then, what\u2019s with me turning into a ghost and following Huo Zheng? Was that really just a dream?\u2019\nShe turned to look at Huo Zheng, but as soon as she turned, she met his deep and dark eyes. He was looking at her as though he was afraid that she would suddenly disappear.\nLin Xiaowan recalled the strange dream where Huo Zheng almost strangled Song Zhiyi to death in a fit of rage. She also recalled how Huo Zheng had carried her out of the car and whispered that he only wanted to marry her.\nLin Xiaowan was at a loss. Whether it was this life or her previous life, it seemed like there were many things that she did not know.\nShe coughed lightly, clearing her throat. She was just about to speak again when she saw Huo Zheng leap to his feet, looking anxious.\nHuo Zheng touched her forehead and asked worriedly, \u201cWhy did you suddenly cough? Does your throat hurt?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan was slightly stunned. \u201cNo, it doesn\u2019t.\u201d\nShe only felt that her throat was a little blocked, as if there was phlegm.\n\nHowever, Huo Zheng still looked worried. He turned on the diffuser at the side.\nLin Xiaowan sniffed the wisps of mist rising from the machine. It smelled strange, but it was not unpleasant. She asked curiously, \u201cDid you add something?\u201d\n\u201cYes, it\u2019s good for you,\u201d Huo Zheng said as he poured a glass of warm water for her and held it to her mouth.\nAfter drinking a few mouthfuls, Lin Xiaowan moved away, and Huo Zheng set the glass down on the low cabinet before he focused on warming her hand, which had turned cold, again.\nLin Xiaowan stared at Huo Zheng, who wore a serious expression on his face. She recalled what she had heard earlier and asked, slightly embarrassed, \u201cYou\u2026 Did you call me \u2018baby\u2019 earlier?\u201d\nHuo Zheng did not respond.\nLin Xiaowan hit him lightly with her other hand. \u201cSay something.\u201d\nHuo Zheng looked at her eyes that were shining with expectations and replied helplessly, \u201cMm.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan could not help but straighten her back and leaned toward him. Her interest was piqued. In her previous life, Huo Zheng had addressed her as \u2018Qingqing\u2019 until the day she died. Why did he suddenly change in this life?\n\u201cWhy did you call me that? Is that how you refer to me when I\u2019m not around?\u201d\nHuo Zheng ignored her. He tucked the blanket for her and said, \u201cDon\u2019t move.\u201d\nHowever, his ears were slightly red.\nLin Xiaowan did not give up. Before her brain could stop her, she said, \u201cWhy are you embarrassed? When you wrote love letters to Song Zhiyi in the past, you were even more affectionate.\u201d\nHuo Zheng was stunned. \u201cYou saw the love letter?\u201d\nThere was a love letter hidden in a book in his study. He had written it before his breakup with Song Zhiyi. They had broken up before he could give it to her. He had casually slipped it between the pages of a book he was reading at that time, and he had completely forgotten about it. It had lay forgotten for many years.\nHowever, one night, after Lin Xiaowan fell asleep, he went to the study to work. For some inexplicable reason, he suddenly felt like reading that book. When he saw the love letter, he felt guilty. At the same time, he was also glad that Lin Xiaowan did not come to the study and did not discover the letter. At that time, he wanted to throw the letter away, but he felt uneasy. In the end, he decided to bring it to the company. He put it through a paper shredder until it could not be pieced back together before he finally threw it away.\nHe really did not expect Lin Xiaowan to have seen it.\nLin Xiaowan asked unhappily, \u201cWhat? Can\u2019t I look at it?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant,\u201d Huo Zheng said before he added, \u201cI\u2019ve already thrown it away.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen did you write it?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026 A long time ago.\u201d\nSeeing that Huo Zheng was so curt with his words, Lin Xiaowan felt a little angry. \u201cYou still won\u2019t tell me about the matter between you and Song Zhiyi?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan recalled the days when she was held captive. Song Zhiyi not only verbally abused her, but Song Zhiyi also forced her to watch a video of Song Zhiyi and Huo Zheng. With this thought in mind, she grew even more unhappy.\nShe pulled her hand away from Huo Zheng and looked away, feeling frustrated.\nHuo Zheng quickly held her hand, making sure she did not yank the needle out. \u201cQingqing!\u201d\nHuo Zheng\u2019s voice was a little loud. Lin Xiaowan was already upset, to begin with, so her eyes reddened immediately. She felt extremely aggrieved.\nHuo Zheng knew that he was a little fierce earlier so he softened his voice and said, \u201cI\u2019m not scolding you. I was just afraid you\u2019d hurt yourself.\u201d\nHowever, how could Lin Xiaowan listen to him at this moment? Her heart was filled with grievances as she sniffled.\nHuo Zheng could not help but panic. After a long while, he finally said, \u201cSong Zhiyi threatened me with evidence detrimental to the Huo family. You and I aren\u2019t married yet. If something happened to the Huo family, at least you wouldn\u2019t be dragged into it if you didn\u2019t know anything.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan was not comforted by her words at all. Instead, she looked even sadder than before.\n\u201cDon\u2019t cry, Qingqing.\u201d\nHuo Zheng held Lin Xiaowan\u2019s hand carefully, not knowing what to do. After a while, he called out softly, \u201cBaby\u2026\u201d\nHis voice was slightly hoarse, but it was gentle and affectionate. He sounded extremely charming.\nLin Xiaowan turned around to look at him with red eyes.\nAfter everything that happened, she had also guessed this was the reason behind Huo Zheng and Song Zhiyi\u2019s frequent interactions in her previous life. However, she did not know why everything happened three years earlier compared to her previous life.\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me about her? You hid so many things from me. Did you want me to hear about it from other people? I know you were together with her since junior high school, and you were together for seven years before breaking up. Did you want me to find out about it from Song Zhiyi?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan stared at the speechless Huo Zheng and continued to say, \u201cYou said that you didn\u2019t have any contact with her after breaking up, but she told me that even after breaking up, you cared about each other\u2019s well-being. To her, I seemed to be a shameless person who hindered both of you.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like that,\u201d Huo Zheng protested.\nLin Xiaowan did not want to listen to him. \u201cIf you had told me about the two of you from the beginning, how could she have found a loophole to exploit? In fact, I didn\u2019t meet for the first time in Yiran Restaurant. She called me out a few days before that.\u201d\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

I should have talked to you when I learned about her existence. I always thought you loved her, not me so I didn\u2019t dare to ask.\u201d\nHuo Zheng and Lin Xiaowan\u2019s relationship had always been strange. They did not even have a proper confession. They had moved in together in a hurry and got married soon after. He had always been polite and reserved. He was also the son of a wealthy family, and she felt that they were from different worlds. She had no confidence at all in the relationship since the beginning. Therefore, she did not dare to ask about anything.\nWhen she became a ghost next to Huo Zheng, she experienced many strange and mysterious things by Huo Zheng\u2019s side. After seeing him strangle Song Zhiyi, she suddenly realized there were many things that she did not know.\nThe injury on the back of Lin Xiaowan\u2019s head had yet to heal. She could not help but reach up to touch it.\n\u201cDo you have a headache?\u201d Huo Zheng asked nervously.\nSeeing that he changed the topic, Lin Xiaowan cried out indignantly, \u201cHuo Zheng!\u201d\nHuo Zheng kissed the back of her hand and said with a sigh, \u201cAfter breaking up with her, I had no feelings for her anymore.\u201d\n\u201cThen do you like me?\u201d\n\u201cI only like you,\u201d Huo Zheng replied seriously, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I should\u2019ve told you this earlier.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan was still unhappy. \u201cThen tell me everything. I\u2019m not talking about the matter with her recently. I\u2019m talking about your past. I want to know. Why did you guys break up? You dated for seven years and were about to get married after all.\u201d\nHuo Zheng found it hard to speak. He was the one who initiated the breakup at that time. To him, who was young and carefree at that time, it was simply a humiliating experience.\nHowever, seeing how concerned Lin Xiaowan was, he could only be truthful. He did not want this matter to bother her anymore. He said, \u201cI discovered she was cheating.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan found it hard to believe. Objectively, Huo Zheng was not extremely handsome, but his eyes were deep and his nose bridge was high. Nonetheless, he was still considered a handsome man with starry eyes. Moreover, his figure was impeccable. His bearing and aura were noble and extraordinary. Considering all things, even a celebrity was slightly inferior to him. How could Song Zhiyi cheat on a man favored by the heavens like Huo Zheng?\n\u201cAre you joking?\u201d\nAfter all, that lunatic Song Zhiyi loved Huo Zheng so much that she even wanted to die with him.\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m not\u2026\u201d\nHuo Zheng found it even more difficult to speak.\n\u201cShe did it with someone in the school field\u2026\u201d\n\nLin Xiaowan\u2019s eyes widened in shock, and an incredulous expression appeared on her face.\n\u2018Was there no one in their school field?\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just one person. While we were dating, she was in a relationship with several \u2018friends\u2019. Her private life was very messy. She wasn\u2019t in love with me. She wanted to climb the social ladder, and she only treated me slightly better than the others. When I was in school, I hid my family background, after all.\u201d\nHuo Zheng was very confident in the past. He did not expect Song Zhiyi to be such a person. How could he accept being played like that?\nThis time, Song Zhiyi returned and threatened him because she wanted to be the young madam of a wealthy family. She returned because of his family background.\nLin Xiaowan thought about Song Zhiyi\u2019s \u2018friends\u2019 and felt a little sympathetic for Huo Zheng at this moment. \u201cYou were really miserable\u2026\u201d\nHuo Zheng and Song Zhiyi dated for seven years. Could it be that Song Zhiyi was like this over the past seven years as well?\nAt the same time, she thought that Huo Zheng was really lucky he did not catch any disease from Song Zhiyi.\nWhen Lin Xiaowan returned to her senses, she asked, frightened, \u201cYou\u2026 Don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re\u2026 not clean\u2026\u201d\nHuo Zheng hurriedly said, \u201cNo, no, I\u2026 I have never touched her before.\u201d\n\u201cYou were together for seven years! Who\u2019d believe you didn\u2019t touch her!\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s true!\u201d Huo Zheng quickly explained, afraid of Lin Xiaowan misunderstanding him, \u201cI was against premarital sex back then so I didn\u2019t touch her!\u201d\nWhen they broke up, Song Zhiyi had used this matter to make fun of Huo Zheng. He was naturally enraged at that time. However, in hindsight, he was glad he did not do anything with her back then.\nLin Xiaowan looked at him skeptically; clearly, she did not believe him.\n\u2018What about the video?\u2019\n\u201cSong Zhiyi showed me a video of the two of you in bed.\u201d\nHuo Zheng was furious upon hearing Song Zhiyi had shown Lin Xiaowan those disgusting things. \u201cShe showed you those things?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan blinked her wet eyes at him. The broken capillaries in her left eye had yet to heal, making her look very pitiful.\nHuo Zheng\u2019s heart softened. He leaned over and kissed her as he said, \u201cI really didn\u2019t. I\u2019ve only done it with you. Videos can be faked by AI. What she showed you was fake.\u201d\n\nLin Xiaowan sorted the information in her head.\nHuo Zheng and Song Zhiyi had dated for seven years, but Song Zhiyi was promiscuous and had multiple partners. Huo Zheng had never touched her before. After discovering her cheating, it was really impossible for them to have positive feelings for each other.\nLin Xiaowan felt much better after thinking about it.\n\u2018He\u2019s still worth keeping\u2026\u2019\nHowever, after a moment, she slammed her hand on the table and asked angrily, \u201cYou were against premarital sex? Then what happened between both of us?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan got together with Huo Zheng in September. Only two months had passed before they consummated their relationship. During her birthday in November, she drank a little. After gaining courage from the alcohol, she pestered Huo Zheng, and they ended up sleeping together. She was a little drunk at that time, but Huo Zheng was not drunk at all!\nHuo Zheng said guiltily, \u201cI said I opposed it in the past\u2026\u201d\nLin Xiaowan said, angry and dissatisfied, \u201cI asked Sister An about what you were like when you were in a relationship. She said you were very passionate. Song Zhiyi also said so. However, when you were with me, you were always so indifferent\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t\u2026\u201d\nHow could he bear to treat her indifferently? However, he also reflected on himself after listening to her words.\n\u201cAnyway, you don\u2019t seem to like me at all.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Huo Zheng said.\nWhen he broke up with Song Zhiyi, Song Zhiyi had questioned his sincerity. She also said that he was immature and clingy. She told him that no girl would be moved by such love and affection. She said his love was fake.\nAt that time, Huo Zheng had sneered, acting like he did not care. However, he remembered every word.\nAfter being single for so many years and being immersed in the business world, he gradually became calm and reserved. He did not think that the person next to him needed him to show his affection and love to her.\nHuo Zheng told Lin Xiaowan about this earnestly and promised to change his ways.\n\u201cTell me what I did wrong, and I\u2019ll do my best to change,\u201d Huo Zheng said.\nSong Zhiyi was already a thing of the past, and it was also time for him to forget those spiteful words.\nNo matter what, he had wronged Lin Xiaowan.\n\u2026\nWhen the IV drip was empty, the nurse came over to help Lin Xiaowan remove the needle. She even brought in a beautifully wrapped apple. She stuffed the apple into Lin Xiaowan\u2019s hands and said with a smile, \u201cToday is Christmas Eve. Miss Lin, get well soon.\u201d\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly. Thank you so much!\n\n", "26": "https://novellive.com/book/becoming-a-wealthy-familys-beloved-after-her-rebirth/chapter-26\n\nIt was already dark outside, and the snow was still falling.\nLin Xiaowan knew it was already December, but she did not know it was already Christmas Eve. She was actually unconscious for half a month.\nAfter the nurse packed the things up and left, Huo Zheng continued to hold Lin Xiaowan\u2019s hand, softly rubbing the needle mark on her hand.\nLin Xiaowan saw the dark circles under his eyes and patted the bed. \u201cCome here and hug me.\u201d\nHuo Zheng climbed into bed and leaned against the headboard. He held her in his arms, unwilling to let go.\n\u201cLet\u2019s make a deal. If there\u2019s anything in the future, you must tell me. You\u2019re not allowed to stay silent,\u201d Lin Xiaowan said.\n\u201cAlright.\u201d\n\u2026\nWhen Lin Xiaowan woke up for her checkup, Huo Zheng had already informed his elder brother and sister-in-law about Lin Xiaowan\u2019s condition.\nIt was already past 5 PM, and it was almost time for dinner. Qiao You\u2019an called and asked what Lin Xiaowan wanted to eat for dinner.\nHuo Zheng did not give Lin Xiaowan a chance to reply and said to Qiao You\u2019an, \u201cMake her something easy to digest.\u201d\n\u201cOkay. How was the checkup? It\u2019s almost the end of the year. After she\u2019s discharged, bring her to the old house to stay.\u201d\nHuo Zheng tilted his head to look at Lin Xiaowan, asking for her opinion.\nLin Xiaowan nodded before Huo Zheng agreed and ended the call.\nAfter that, Lin Xiaowan leaned into Huo Zheng\u2019s arms and chatted with him.\nHuo Zheng asked if she still wanted to go to the North Pole.\n\u201cNorth Pole?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s right. I\u2019m not busy during the New Year. I\u2019ll bring you there.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan was stunned. This was her birthday wish from her previous life. How did he know about it? After a long time, she finally remembered that she had mentioned this in this life. At that time, he had also promised to bring her to the North Pole after he was done dealing with matters.\nLin Xiaowan had lost her interest now. She played with his hand for a long time before she said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to go anymore.\u201d\n\nHuo Zheng did not have any objections and said gently, \u201cAlright.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan hesitated for a long time before she finally sat up to face Huo Zheng.\nAlthough Lin Xiaowan\u2019s injuries had healed a lot when she was unconscious for half a month, they were not completely healed. Huo Zheng did not want her to move around, worried that she would aggravate her wounds. He asked worriedly, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\n\u201cI have something to tell you.\u201d\nShe did not want to keep any more secrets from him.\nHe sat up and said, \u201cDon\u2019t move.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan pointed at him and said, \u201cSo fierce.\u201d\nHuo Zheng looked at her helplessly.\n\u201cLet me tell you a shocking secret.\u201d\nHuo Zheng immediately thought about her family members and her uncle who deserved to die. He thought that she was about to tell him about her family. Unexpectedly, she dropped a bomb on him.\nLin Xiaowan hugged the blanket and said, \u201cActually, I didn\u2019t see the love letter you wrote. When I went to look for it in the book, it was already gone. Don\u2019t think I\u2019m crazy after listening to what I\u2019m about to tell you.\u201d\nAlthough her experience was real, she still felt that it was a little ridiculous.\n\u201cActually, I read the letter in my previous life. In my previous life, I thought you didn\u2019t like me. I didn\u2019t dare to ask you about it. I thought you were cheating on me. After a series of incidents, I was hit by a car and died. Then, I was reborn back in time.\u201d\nAfter listening to her, it was hard for Huo Zheng not to suspect that what she said had something to do with the injury on the back of her head.\n\u201cWhat? You don\u2019t believe me?\u201d\nHuo Zheng did not believe her so he did not say anything.\nLin Xiaowan continued to say, \u201cWe were married for three years, but you didn\u2019t tell me about Song Zhiyi at all in my previous life. One day, you suddenly became busy. Every time you came home, you\u2019d smell of unfamiliar perfume. Moreover, I kept receiving intimate photos of you and Song Zhiyi. I really thought you cheated on me. The day before our wedding anniversary, I saw you picking a ring for her. I was very sad at that time. When I fled, I got into a car accident while I was crossing the road and died.\u201d\nShe thought about everything she had seen when she was a soul and sighed. \u201cAfter listening to you, I guessed you were so close to her back then because she was threatening you as well\u2026 However, I didn\u2019t know at that time. I thought you always liked her so I was very sad.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan looked very serious and a little sad when she spoke. A frown could be seen on her face as well.\nHuo Zheng reached out to smooth the frown on her face. He was about to speak when the nightmares he had when Lin Xiaowan was being held captive appeared in his mind. In the nightmares, she lay in his arms covered in blood. Suddenly, he choked and could not speak.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Lin Xiaowan looked at him, puzzled.\n\nHuo Zheng\u2019s head suddenly began to hurt. He massaged his temples and closed his eyes. The pain was like a tidal wave, and his ears were ringing. He was worried about scaring Lin Xiaowan so he forced himself to tell her that he was fine. However, he could not move at all. He suddenly broke out in cold sweat.\nLin Xiaowan had never seen Huo Zheng like that before. She asked nervously, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Do you have a headache?\u201d\nShe began to regret telling him about her rebirth. After all, it was a matter of two different worlds. Who knew if Huo Zheng was affected by this knowledge?\nHuo Zheng\u2019s grip on Lin Xiaowan\u2019s hand was very tight. Although she was in pain, she did not break free and allowed him to hold her hand.\n\u201cCan you hear me? Can you let go of my hand so I can call the doctor?\u201d\nHuo Zheng did hear Lin Xiaowan at all as scene after scene flashed in his mind. The scene came to a stop at the moment Lin Xiaowan lay in the ancestral hall covered by white cloth. Then, he lost consciousness.\nLin Xiaowan\u2019s heart raced in her chest. She panicked and called his name. It took a while before she remembered to press the bell to call the doctor.\nShe was severely injured to begin with. The sudden stimulation made it difficult for her to breathe.\nWhen the medical staff came in, a female staff member quickly helped Lin Xiaowan to calm down.\n\u201cDon\u2019t be anxious. Calm down. It\u2019s okay, it\u2019s okay. Take a deep breath and let yourself relax.\u201d\nThe other party helped Lin Xiaowan back to the bed and poured a glass of water for her.\n\u201cAlright, it\u2019s alright now.\u201d\nAfter Lin Xiaowan regained her composure, she grabbed the doctor and asked tremblinbly, \u201cWhat happened to him?\u201d\nThe examination was very quick. The doctor said, puzzled, \u201cMr. Huo is fine. He\u2019s just a little overworked. Why did he suddenly faint?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan naturally did not say anything about her rebirth. She remained silent and looked at the doctor with teary eyes.\nSeeing the worried expression on her face, the doctor said reassuringly, \u201cIt\u2019s okay. It\u2019ll be fine when he wakes up.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan sobbed and said softly, \u201cThank you, doctor.\u201d\nShe really regretted her words earlier, and she vowed not to speak rashly again.\nWhen Huo Zheng woke up, she was going to tell him that it was all a dream she had. If Huo Zheng blamed her for talking nonsense, so be it.\n\u201cAlright, stop crying. Let me examine your eye.\u201d\nThe doctor\u2019s face and eyes were kind, and he spoke in a kind tone like that of an elder.\nLin Xiaowan wiped her tears away and raised her head so the doctor could examine her eye.\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

Don\u2019t wipe your eyes with your hands! There are so many bacterias on your hands.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan looked at the female nurse blankly.\n\u2018Am I not supposed to rub my eyes with my hands?\u2019\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with my eyes?\u201d\nIt was strange. She did not feel that anything was wrong with her eyes.\n\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. You just burst the capillaries in your eye. Don\u2019t worry. You didn\u2019t feel uncomfortable when you woke up, right? Your vision isn\u2019t affected, right?\u201d\nThe doctor spoke as though he was talking to a child. After all, who would dislike an obedient person?\nLin Xiaowan nodded.\nWhen Huo Cheng and Qiao You\u2019an arrived, they saw Huo Zheng lying unconscious at the side and the medical staff in the room.\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d\n\u201cMr. Huo suddenly fainted so we came to check on him. There\u2019s nothing wrong with him. Perhaps, he fainted because of low blood pressure or because he was stimulated. It\u2019s fine. He\u2019ll recover by tonight or tomorrow morning\u2026\u201d the doctor said.\nHuo Cheng nodded in relief when he heard that there was nothing wrong with Huo Zheng.\nAfter the doctor was done examining Lin Xiaowan\u2019s eye, he told her that she would have to take an X-Ray a few days later before she left. If she was worried, he told her she could get her eyes tested again. However, he assured her that nothing seemed to be wrong with her eyes.\n\u201cThank you, doctor.\u201d\nQiao You\u2019an raised the insulated lunch\u00a0box in her hand and asked, \u201cXiaowan, are you hungry? You slept for a long time. You must be hungry. Why don\u2019t you eat something?\u201d\nQiao You\u2019an wanted to set up a small table at the side of the bed, but Lin Xiaowan stopped her. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. My arms and legs are fine. Let\u2019s eat at the dining table.\u201d\nThe meal was made by the chef at home. There was beet meatball vegetable soup, stir-fried vegetables, steamed pigeon with eggplant, and sweet braised pear with candied dates.\n\nIt was obvious that the meal was also meant for Huo Zheng, but he could not eat it now.\nLin Xiaowan enjoyed the food, but she found it a little bland. She preferred food with stronger tastes.\nQiao You\u2019an urged, \u201cEat more. You\u2019re thin, to begin with. After lying in bed for half a month, you\u2019ve grown even thinner.\u201d\n\u201cHave you spoken to Huo Zheng?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan held the porcelain bowl with braised pear and nodded.\n\u201cWhat did he say?\u201d Huo Cheng asked curiously, \u201cThe doctor even said he might be stimulated.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan stammered. In the end, she only said that they spoke about the past before Huo Zheng fainted.\nHuo Cheng asked incredulously, \u201cSo did he stimulate himself by talking about the past? Was he stimulated by his past?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan was at a loss for words. She felt that it had more to do with her talking about her rebirth. She said hesitantly, \u201cAh, that doesn\u2019t seem to be the case\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWhen did my brother become so frail?\u201d Huo Cheng sat at the side, immersed in his thoughts.\n\u2026\nThe couple stayed with Lin Xiaowan for a while before they finally left.\nEven when it was late at night, and Lin Xiaowan felt sleepy, Huo Zheng still did not wake up.\nThe bed was big enough for two people. Lin Xiaowan lay next to Huo Zheng and stared at him. After she turned off the light, she tossed and turned for a while before she finally rolled into his arms.\n\u2026\nThe next morning when Lin Xiaowan woke up, Huo Zheng had already woken up. He had already changed his clothes and was leaning against the headboard and working on his laptop. When he saw that she had woken up, he put his laptop aside and lowered his head to kiss her.\nHuo Zheng kissed Lin Xiaowan for a long time. When she finally regained her senses, she asked with glistening eyes, \u201cWhat was that for?\u201d\n\u201cI remembered a lot of things. I remembered things from our previous life,\u201d Huo Zheng said. He stared at her and caressed her delicate face with his big hand. It was tender and affectionate.\n\nHuo Zheng hugged her and kissed her cheek before he sighed softly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\nIn the previous life, he lived a lonely life without Lin Xiaowan.\nAfter Lin Xiaowan left, he sent some to inform her family in Beicheng. At that time, he was prepared to be beaten and scolded. After all, their daughter had died by his side. Unexpectedly, his assistant returned with 200 yuan. It was Lin Xiaowan\u2019s aunt called \u2018consolation money\u2019.\nIt was only later that Huo Zheng found out that Lin Xiaowan grew up uncared for like weeds in her family.\nHe saw the text messages and photos on Lin Xiaowan\u2019s phone during those few months. He was filled with self-blame and regret in the latter half of his life. Every time he thought about it, his heart was wrenched in pain.\nHe had dealt with the Dong family ruthlessly and punished Song Zhiyi cruelly. He even quarreled with Huo Cheng over the information that Song Zhiyi obtained in the past. In the end, they did not speak for almost a year. However, when it came down to it, the person he hated the most was himself.\nWhen he finally regained consciousness and saw Lin Xiaowan sleeping soundly next to him, no one knew how grateful he was that the heavens sent his lost treasure back to him.\n\u201cDon\u2019t apologize.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan did not blame him anymore. She reached out and hugged him as she said, \u201cI know you had my best interest at heart. However, I don\u2019t want to be left in the dark. Sister and\u2026\u201d\nLin Xiaowan had not addressed Huo Cheng directly for a long time so for a moment, she did not know how to address him.\nHuo Zheng looked at her patiently as he caressed her head. Due to her injury, her hair had been cut short. After half a month, it had grown a little longer. Her hair fell beneath her ears, making her look very cute.\nLin Xiaowan continued to say, \u201cSister An can face these things with Brother Cheng, and I can also face them with you. You can protect me, right?\u201d\nHuo Zheng now controlled half of the economy in Shangxia. Very few people could compete with him. He said, \u201cI can.\u201d\n\u201cAlright,\u201d Lin Xiaowan said. She got out of his embrace before she waved her hand and said, \u201cSince you\u2019re so confident, I\u2019ll give you a chance to pursue me.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Huo Zheng was stunned.\n\u201cPursue me,\u201d Lin Xiaowan said with a magnanimous expression on her face, \u201cYou didn\u2019t think I was joking about breaking up, right? You didn\u2019t even confess before we got together. I\u2019ll give you a chance to pursue me now. After that, you have to confess to me. When the time is right, you have to propose to me. Oh, the proposal shouldn\u2019t be too grand. Let\u2019s just be low-key about it. I don\u2019t want too many people to be involved.\u201d\nHuo Zheng nodded indulgently. \u201cAlright, we\u2019ll do as you say, but I have one condition.\u201d\nHe held Lin Xiaowan\u2019s right hand. After so many things happened, the ring was still on her finger. He said, \u201cYou can\u2019t take off your ring.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s fine with me.\u201d\nAll Lin Xiaowan wanted was to make up for the things in her past life. The end result was the same. She needed a sense of security and so did Huo Zheng.\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

Where am I going to wear the other ring?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan looked slightly troubled as though she was seriously thinking about this matter.\nHuo Zheng felt that she was extremely cute and wanted to laugh. However, he was worried she would be angry so he suppressed his laughter and replied, \u201cI\u2019ll tell you when I\u2019m about to propose, and at that time, you can remove this ring.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan thought about it and was quite satisfied with his solution. \u201cAlright.\u201d\nThen, she raised her chin and said, \u201cYou have to pursue me properly. Otherwise, I won\u2019t agree to marry you. It won\u2019t be easy.\u201d\nHuo Zheng could not conceal his smile at all. \u201cOkay.\u201d\nSeeing how he agreed so readily, Lin Xiaowan looked at him skeptically and asked, \u201cDo you even know how to pursue women? How did you pursue Song Zhiyi back then? You have to treat me 10,000 times better than you did her when you were pursuing him. Do you understand?\u201d\n\u201cI understand,\u201d Huo Zheng replied with a nod. Then, thinking that they agreed to be honest with each other, he only hesitated a moment before he said, \u201cI didn\u2019t pursue her. She pursued me.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan patted his head and sighed. \u201cYou were so naive and easily deceived back then\u2026\u201d\nBack then, Huo Zheng was still a pure and innocent young man. He was indeed easy to deceive.\nHuo Zheng\u2019s ears turned red.\nAfter this ordeal, the two of them were open with each other. Not only did Lin Xiaowan change, but Huo Zheng changed as well.\nLin Xiaowan pouted and said, dissatisfied, \u201cShe addressed you in such an intimate manner, but I only addressed you by your name\u2026 You allow her to call you Brother Huo. Why didn\u2019t you tell me to call you that?\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t tell her to call me Brother Huo, and I didn\u2019t like the way she called me either,\u201d Huo Zheng said. At the same time, he wanted to tell Lin Xiaowan to address him as \u2018Hubby\u2019 or \u2018Husband\u2019, but knowing her, she would probably hit him out of embarrassment.\n\u201cAlright, then I\u2019ll think about what to call you\u2026\u201d\n\u2026\nWhen the nurse came in with the medicine and breakfast, she saw Lin Xiaowan leaning against Huo Zheng and chatting animatedly. She smiled and said, \u201cMr. Huo, you\u2019re awake. Do you feel unwell? You fainted suddenly yesterday. Miss Lin was very worried.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan\u2019s face flushed in embarrassment. \u201cLet\u2019s not talk about that anymore.\u201d\nIt had snowed the entire night and only stopped this morning. It was overcast outside, and there was a thick layer of snow.\n\u201cCan I go out for a walk after I eat?\u201d Lin Xiaowan asked the nurse.\nThe nurse had been assigned to Lin Xiaowan since Lin Xiaowan was admitted to the hospital. She knew Lin Xiaowan\u2019s condition very well. When she heard Lin Xiaowan\u2019s words, she looked a little troubled as she replied tactfully, \u201cI\u2019m afraid that won\u2019t do. It\u2019s a little too cold outside.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan lowered her head, looking disappointed. She was born in winter, and she liked the snow. When she was born, it was snowing heavily. She thought it was a pity she could not build a snowman today.\nThe nurse saw the pitiful expression on Lin Xiaowan\u2019s face, and her heart surged with motherly love. Her heart softened, and she said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t I talk to Dr. Zhang first?\u201d\nDr. Zhang was the kind-looking doctor from before.\nLin Xiaowan\u2019s eyes lit up immediately while Huo Zheng\u2019s gaze was icy when he looked at the nurse.\nThe nurse could not withstand the pressure from Huo Zheng\u2019s gaze. She chuckled and quickly left the room. Before leaving, she reminded him that Lin Xiaowan\u2019s medicine should be taken after her food.\n\u2026\n\nIn the end, Lin Xiaowan did not go out. Huo Zheng did not allow it.\nMoreover, when Doctor Zhang came over, he listened to her breathing with his stethoscope and rejected her request to go outside with an amiable smile on his face.\n\u201cWait another week. If you go out now, it\u2019ll be easy for you to catch a cold.\u201d\nAlas, the snow would already melt by next week unless it began to snow heavily again.\nSince she could not go out, she tormented Huo Zheng and asked him to cut the apple into the shape of bunnies. He did not know how to do this and could only learn clumsily.\nWhen his secretary and assistant came, he was finally rescued from the torment.\n\u2026\nAt lunch.\nAfter dealing with his work, Huo Zheng asked, \u201cHave you thought about what you want to call me?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan bit her chopsticks and looked at him hesitantly before she said softly, looking embarrassed, \u201cCan I just call you \u2018Brother?\u2019?\nHuo Zheng laughed and kissed her. \u201cAlright.\u201d\n\u2026\nLin Xiaowan stayed in the hospital for another week.\nAfter the 8th of the 12th lunar month, Lin Xiaowan\u2019s post-surgery wounds were almost healed. She no longer wanted to stay in the hospital and begged to be discharged. She felt that it was pointless for her to continue staying in the hospital.\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

He was amused when he saw Lin Xiaowan carefully following the video tutorial on how to thread colored beads with a thin copper wire. He asked, \u201cIs this fun?\u201d\nIn addition to the photo album and brushes, there were also architectural models that were pieced together on the ground. Huo Zheng had almost moved his entire office to this place. He would work and have meetings here every day, and his secretary and assistant had to run\u00a0back and forth every day.\nLin Xiaowan gestured to Huo Zheng to come over before she showed him the pendant she was making. It was a talisman for examinations. She asked, \u201cCan I hang this in your car when the time comes?\u201d\nOf course, Huo Zheng would not say no. Let alone hanging it in his car, he would not say no even if she asked him to wear it.\n\u201cYou won\u2019t let me go out for a walk even though I\u2019m hospitalized. I think I\u2019ve recovered,\u201d Lin Xiaowan said, pouting.\nHuo Zheng touched the back of her head. The swelling had not gone down completely. He said, coaxing her, \u201cLet\u2019s wait for a few more days. Once the doctor says everything is fine, we\u2019ll leave, okay?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost the lunar new year. I don\u2019t want to spend the new year in the hospital.\u201d\n\u201cYou won\u2019t,\u201d Huo Zheng promised.\n\u2026\nIt was getting close to the lunar new year.\n\nApart from Huo Cheng and Qiao You\u2019an, Qin Yanchuan and his wife visited as well. The three men began to talk about work as soon as they met so Qiao You\u2019an chased them out to the next room.\nLin Xiaowan looked at the unfamiliar woman in front of her and smiled tentatively.\nGu Yuwu was about the same age as Lin Xiaowan. She had almond-shaped eyes and red lips. She was extremely beautiful. She had dyed her long hair, and her makeup was exquisite. She looked like a character that had walked out of a book.\nGu Yuwu took the initiative to speak. She said, \u201cI\u2019ve seen your photo in Qin Yanchuan\u2019s study. You look even better in person. I have long wanted to meet you.\u201d\nQiao You\u2019an had known Gu Wuyu for a long time now. Upon hearing Gu Wuyu\u2019s words, she said proudly, \u201cIt\u2019s not just that. Xiaowan is usually very cute as well. You\u2019ll know it once you get to know her.\u201d\nThe feeling of being praised by another woman, especially a beautiful one, was very good. It was not something that could be described.\nLin Xiaowan was not aloof. She said, \u201cYou look very good too\u2026 And you smell very nice as well\u2026\u201d\nThen, just to be fair, Lin Xiaowan turned to Qiao You\u2019an and said, \u201cSister, you look very, very, very good too\u2026\u201d\nLin Xiaowan used the word \u2018very\u2019 thrice to show her sincerity.\nAfter that, the three women quickly brought out small plates to eat the skewered octopus meatballs that Gu Yuwu brought over.\nAs Gu Yuwu opened the packaging, she asked with a hint of uncertainty, \u201cCan Xiaowan eat seafood?\u201d\n\nMore than a month had passed since Lin Xiaowan\u2019s surgery. She was recovering well, but Huo Zheng was very strict with her diet. She had mentioned a few times that she wanted to eat sweet and sour prawn balls and steamed bass, but she was mercilessly rejected.\nLin Xiaowan glanced at the closed door a few times before she whispered, \u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d\nThen, Lin Xiaowan complained, \u201cHuo Zheng is too strict. He doesn\u2019t allow me to eat many things. However, the doctor said it\u2019s fine as long as I eat those things in moderation.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan had only been eating very bland food. Most of her meals were soup or stir-fried dishes. The chef of the Huo family, who was paid very well, did not even put any seasoning in her meals. At this time, she really craved food like fried chicken and roast duck from the roadside stalls. She really wished she could order takeaway. However, since Huo Zheng accompanied her to eat those bland meals, she could not complain.\nNow that the golden and greasy octopus balls were finally placed in front of her, she naturally could not resist. When the fragrance of the mixed sauce permeated the room, Lin Xiaowan could not help but gulp a few times.\nQiao You\u2019an saw Lin Xiaowan holding the skewer and staring at the food greedily. Despite pretending to be reserved, she could see the words \u2018I want to eat\u2019 were written all over Lin Xiaowan\u2019s body at this moment. She laughed and said, \u201cAlright, hurry up and eat. You must be hungry.\u201d\n\u201cThis honey mustard sauce is very delicious. I always ask for it. Try it.\u201d\nThe octopus balls were stuffed with corn and chopped vegetables, and their skin was fried to crispy perfection.\nLin Xiaowan tested the temperature and quickly took a bite before exclaiming, \u201cIt\u2019s tasty!\u201d\nLin Xiaowan\u2019s eyes were closed, and she looked happy as she chewed on the octopus ball.\nGu Yuwu chuckled. \u201cHow cute. Xiaowan, you look just like a small animal when you eat.\u201d\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

The octopus balls were not small, and it was quite filling. She still wanted to eat but was embarrassed. She asked, \u201cWhere did you buy this? It\u2019s really delicious!\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s the stall in the alley next to a middle school on North-South Island Bay Road. It\u2019s been around for almost twenty years. The food there is delicious, and the soup is particularly good,\u201d Gu Yuwu replied. She liked seeing how happy and satisfied Lin Xiaowan looked when she was eating so she pushed another octopus ball to Lin Xiaowan and said, \u201cEat more if you like it.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan did not stand on ceremony and quickly ate the octopus ball.\nThe trio continued to talk, and the topic drifted to the heavy snow recently. The snow covered the city for an entire day and night, making the city look beautiful. Scenic spots in the city looked even more beautiful with the snow.\nQiao You\u2019an chimed in, telling the others about how her sons had built a snowman in the yard.\nUpon hearing this, Lin Xiaowan said indignantly, \u201cI wanted to go out and play with the snow as well, but Huo Zheng wouldn\u2019t let me. I wanted to build a snowman too.\u201d\nThe last time Lin Xiaowan built a snowman was when she was very, very young. That year, it snowed heavily in Beicheng. At that time, her uncle brought her out and helped her scoop buckets of snow to build a huge snowman.\nGu Yuwu could hear the disappointment dripping from Lin Xiaowan\u2019s words so she asked, \u201cI have photos of when it was snowing. Do you want to see them?\u201d\n\nThe photos were turned into a slide of video. It had more than 200,000 views, and it was uploaded to the platform, Bobo Star. The title was very direct: Snow in the Streets of Sheng City.\nThe 20-minute video was divided into two parts; one showed the street during the day, and the other at night.\nLin Xiaowan was fascinated. She watched it with rapt attention.\nThe photos were very well taken. One showed a sweet potato stall at night. The stall owner stood behind the cart as it snowed, and he was rubbing his arms. Another one showed two pedestrians, probably a couple, holding an umbrella as they crossed the zebra crossing. There was even one that showed small paw prints on the snow-covered ground as a cat jumped onto the roof of a car.\nWhile Lin Xiaowan looked at the photos, Gu Yuwu seriously spoke about angles and what shutter speed she used when she was taking the photos.\nLin Xiaowan said sincerely, \u201cYou\u2019re really awesome. The photos are all very good!\u201d\nSeeing that Lin Xiaowan was interested, she said, \u201cYou can go back to the main page. I have other street photos as well\u2026\u201d\nWorried that Lin Xiaowan was not familiar with the interface, Gu Yuwu leaned over and said, \u201cClick on the small white arrow in the upper left corner.\u201d\nAlthough Lin Xiaowan had never used this platform before, she had often used other video platforms to watch dramas and variety shows. For this reason, it was not difficult for her to navigate her way.\nLin Xiaowan saw the video, Snow in the Streets of Sheng City, at the top of the page since it was recently uploaded. Soon, her attention was caught by the user information on the page. She exclaimed, \u201cWow! You have more than three million followers!\u201d\n\nLin Xiaowan scrolled down and discovered that there were only a few street photos. In fact, the number of videos, in general, was not a lot. As she scrolled down, she also saw photos of people. The number of views was quite high, and there were also many comments.\nGu Yuwu scratched her head and said, \u201cI studied photography.\nGu Yuwu studied photography, but after graduation, she somehow was roped into acting in an online drama and entered the entertainment industry. However, she had no interest in acting or being an actress. She was now part of the committee responsible for reforming the entertainment industry. With her background and capital, she was a domineering figure in the entertainment industry.\nIn the end, photography only became Gu Yuwu\u2019s personal hobby.\nIn fact, if Lin Xiaowan had gone on Whisper, the largest social media platform in Shangxia, she would have found that Gu Yuwu\u2019s fame far exceeded three million followers. There was another 0 behind the 3,000,000.\nLin Xiaowan did not have much interest in celebrities so she was unaware of these things. Moreover, apart from that online drama and a few cameos, Gu Yuwu did not make an appearance in front of the cameras. As such, it was even more unlikely for Lin Xiaowan to know about a behind-the-scenes bigshot.\n\u201cCan I have a look at these videos as well?\u201d\nGu Yuwu replied with a smile, \u201cOf course.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan watched the videos one by one.\nSometimes, Gu Yuwu\u2019s voice could be heard in the videos, but she never appeared in front of the camera. The photos were not taken in a studio, and they were all taken in natural settings. They depicted people living their daily lives.\nThere were photos of people eating watermelons, drinking soda, playing with cats and dogs, buying fruits, and so on. Although the subject of the photos was ordinary, there was something special in their simplicity. However, it had to be said that the people in the photos were all very good-looking.\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

She also listened attentively to the explanation such as what kind of cameras and lenses were used and why they were chosen.\nAfter Lin Xiaowan finished watching one of the videos, Qiao You\u2019an asked tentatively, \u201cXiaowan, are you also interested in photography?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan nodded shyly.\nBefore going to university, Lin Xiaowan also thought about studying photography. However, after thinking about it, she thought that her financial circumstances did not allow her to study art.\n\u201cYou like photography? I can teach you,\u201d Gu Yuwu said magnanimously.\nLin Xiaowan quickly shook her head. She did not have the necessary equipment to do so after all.\nQiao You\u2019an said gently, \u201cXiaowan, if you like it, you should give it a try. If you find that you don\u2019t like it later, you can find another hobby.\u201d\nIn Qiao You\u2019an\u2019s opinion, Lin Xiaowan was too much of a homebody.\nLin Xiaowan did not go out much, and she looked unenthusiastic on the few occasions Qiao You\u2019an was free and invited her to go shopping. She rarely bought anything. She also did not seem to have any friends her age, and she always seemed a little lonely.\nIn Qiao You\u2019an\u2019s opinion, it would be good if Lin Xiaowan could find a few hobbies and make some friends.\nAfter cleaning up the octopus balls, Gu Yuwu casually shared a few pieces of news and gossip from the entertainment industry.\nLin Xiaowan usually did not pay attention to this so she was a little lost. She asked, \u201cWhat do you mean by on-set couples? Do they meet while filming and get together?\u201d\nGu Yuwu winked at Lin Xiaowan and said meaningfully, \u201cSomething like that. It doesn\u2019t just apply to the actors and actresses. It\u2019s the production team. Filming takes at least a few months, and everyone\u2019s together all the time. Moreover, they have to film emotional scenes sometimes. It\u2019s easy to get caught up in the emotions. If they have\u2026 needs\u2026 they\u2019d get together\u2026\u201d\nLin Xiaowan\u2019s eyes widened immediately.\nGu Yuwu continued to say, \u201cThese things are usually secret. After the filming, the crew will disband and so will the couple.\u201d\nThen, Gu Yuwu put her hand to the side of her mouth and said conspiratorially in a low voice, \u201cLet me tell you another thing. Sometimes, the people involved are already married.\u201d\nUpon hearing this, Qiao You\u2019an rolled her eyes and said, \u201cStop, stop! Don\u2019t lead Xiaowan astray.\u201d\nGu Yuwu laughed.\nOn the other hand, Lin Xiaowan was so shocked that she was at a loss for words.\n\nGu Yuwu asked, \u201cXiaowan, do you have any interest in joining a production team?\u201d\nAfter listening to so much gossip, the entertainment industry was no longer clean in Lin Xiaowan\u2019s heart. She shook her head without hesitation, and in the process, the back of her head began to hurt. She instinctively raised her hand to touch it.\nQiao You\u2019an said worriedly, \u201cBe careful.\u201d\nGu Yuwu raised her hands and said with a laugh, \u201cIt\u2019s my fault. I won\u2019t tease you anymore.\u201d\nAfter that, the trio continued to chat happily.\n\u2026\nWhen everyone left, Lin Xiaowan continued making the small charm. It was a little too quiet so she played music from her phone. However, after playing the music, she began to feel restless.\nWhen Huo Zheng finally returned to the room with dinner, he told her to wash her hands and eat.\nLin Xiaowan quickly washed her hands. When she returned, she asked, \u201cWhen can I be discharged?\u201d\nWhen she saw the bland meal, she added unhappily, \u201cHuo Zheng, I want to eat sweet and sour prawn balls.\u201d\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you secretly eat octopus balls in the afternoon?\u201d Huo Zheng asked, \u201cBy the way, what did you call me?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan quickly corrected herself. She said in a soft voice, \u201cBrother.\u201d\nHuo Zheng felt as though he was going to melt when he heard her voice.\nAlthough Lin Xiaowan was the one who suggested addressing him in this manner, she could not help but feel embarrassed in the beginning. After all, she had never addressed anyone in such a familiar way. However, after being reminded by Huo Zheng several times, she had already gotten used to it; she no longer felt embarrassed.\nLin Xiaowan gestured with her hands and said, \u201cI only ate a little.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan realized that Huo Zheng seemed much easier to talk to when she called him \u2018Brother\u2019.\nHuo Zheng sighed helplessly, but his expression was very happy. He did not say anything about her eating the octopus balls at all.\n\u2026\nThe lunar new year was early this year. It fell on the 21st. At this time, it was almost the lunar new year.\nLin Xiaowan mentioned again that she wanted to be discharged.\nEarly in the morning, Huo Zheng woke Lin Xiaowan up and helped her clean up before he\u00a0brought her for a comprehensive physical examination.\n\nEver since Lin Xiaowan was injured, she would get exhausted easily, making her particularly sleepy. When she lived with Huo Zheng in the past, she would go to bed early and wake up early. However, no matter how early it was, she had never gotten up at seven AM.\nLin Xiaowan yawned and complained, \u201cWhat kind of doctor comes to work at 7?\u201d\n\u201cDoctor Zhang,\u201d Huo Zheng replied. Then, he added, \u201cBy the way, It\u2019s already past 7.30 AM.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan scoffed and said, \u201cYou must have forced him to come in so early!\u201d\nAlthough Lin Xiaowan was dissatisfied that she had to wake up so early, she still followed Huo Zheng.\n\u2026\nBy the time the examination was done, it was already 10 AM.\nLin Xiaowan\u2019s stomach growled. She had not eaten anything since she woke up.\nDoctor Zhang gave her a packet of milk-flavored shortbread that he brought out from the drawer and said, \u201cA student gave this to me earlier. You can have it.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan thanked Doctor Zhang, but she did not reach for it immediately. Instead, she looked at Huo Zheng.\nUpon seeing this, Doctor Zhang stuffed the pastry into Lin Xiaowan\u2019s hands and said, \u201cI\u2019m giving it to you, not him. Why are you looking at him?\u201d\nSeeing that Huo Zheng did not object, Lin Xiaowan held the pastry tightly and thanked Doctor Zhang again. Her earlier gloominess was gone, and she visibly lit up in excitement.\nDoctor Zhang said, \u201cAlright, go eat. We\u2019ll talk again when the result comes out in the afternoon.\u201d\nAfter leaving, Lin Xiaowant quickly tore open the package that contained individual packets of pastry. The filling in the middle of the pastry was delicious, and the milky flavor was strong. There were cranberries and nuts in the filling as well.\nAfter eating one, Lin Xiaowan reached out and asked for another one from Huo Zheng, who now held the packet of pastry. Unsurprisingly, he refused.\n\u201cJust have one first. You can eat the rest later\u2026\u201d\nHuo Zheng held the pastry with one hand and held her hand with the other.\n\u201cDoctor Zhang gave me that,\u201d Lin Xiaowan complained. She looked at him meaningfully, hoping he would give in.\nHuo Zheng ignored her.\nLin Xiaowan fumed with anger upon seeing this. After walking for a while, she shook their hands and said, \u201cYou didn\u2019t really hold my hand in the past.\u201d\nThe two of them seldom went out together. Even when they went out, they rarely had physical contact.\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

At home, Huo Zheng liked to hold her in his arms and would frequently kiss her.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t like it?\u201d Huo Zheng asked.\nEver since Huo Zheng dreamed about his previous life and Lin Xiaowan\u2019s accident, he felt surreal. He felt as though he could only anchor himself in this reality when he held her firmly in his arms. He was afraid that if he let go, he would lose her again.\n\u201cI like it,\u201d Lin Xiaowan replied. However, she suddenly exclaimed, \u201cNo! You can\u2019t hold my hand now!\u201d\nHuo Zheng was stunned. However, not only did he not let go, but he even tightened his grip on her hand. He asked, \u201cWhy?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan said seriously, \u201cYou\u2019re pursuing me now. We shouldn\u2019t hold hands or kiss when you\u2019re pursuing me.\u201d\nThen, Lin Xiaowan hurriedly added, \u201cWe can\u2019t sleep together as well! You have to be a gentleman.\u201d\nHuo Zheng was speechless. He really wanted to go back on his words at this moment. He finally said, \u201cLet\u2019s discuss this after eating.\u201d\n\u201cAlright,\u201d Lin Xiaowan said, shaking their hands again, \u201cLet go of my hand first.\u201d\nHuo Zheng turned a deaf ear to her words. Instead, he dangled the pastry in front of her, attempting to distract her as she said, \u201cHave another one.\u201d\nHowever, Huo Zheng needed two hands to open the packaging. This meant he would have to let go of her hand. He paused for a moment before he said, \u201cForget it.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan, who was already in the midst of reaching out for the pastry, looked at Huo Zheng in confusion. She completely forgot about not holding hands at this moment.\n\u2026\nWhen Lin Xiaowan was about to take a nap in the afternoon, Huo Zheng wanted to hug her, but she refused him. She wrapped herself in the blanket like a spring roll, leaving only her head exposed as she said, \u201cI\u2019m going to sleep.\u201d\nHuo Zheng looked at her speechlessly. Then, he said, \u201cLet\u2019s discuss this matter again.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean? You can\u2019t go back on your words,\u201d Lin Xiaowan said, looking at him warily. Then, she raised her hand and said, \u201cI kept my words and wore the ring.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy can\u2019t we hold hands?\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s not count the other times. I consider today your first day of pursuing me. How can you hold my hand or kiss me on the first day of pursuing me? You\u2019ll be just like a hooligan if you do that on the first day you pursue me,\u201d Lin Xiaowan, the creator of these love rules, said.\nIn fact, Lin Xiaowan\u2019s request did not make sense at all. She only wanted Huo Zheng to pursue her because she did not like how he was so different from the past. With her, he had always been too calm and restrained. She lacked love and only wanted him to be more passionate. This was just a little trick to warm up their relationship. Neither of them took off their rings. No one would believe they were not together now. Anyone with a discerning eye could tell what was going on.\nLin Xiaowan thought about it for a moment. Since they were on this topic now, she decided to tell him what she wanted lest she forgot about it after two days. She counted with her fingers as she said, \u201cYou have to give me flowers, take me out to eat, and bring me on dates. You have to support me unconditionally no matter what.\u201d\n\u201cFor example, if I want to eat the milk-flavored shortbread, as someone who\u2019s pursuing me, you should\u2019ve immediately offered it to me with two hands!\u201d\nShe said seriously, \u201cOf course, as someone who\u2019s being pursued, I\u2019ll give you gifts. I\u2019ll also treat you very, very well.\u201d\nHuo Zheng was helpless. What could he do? He could only agree to her request.\n\u2026\nWhen Lin Xiaowan finally fell asleep, she was tightly bound in the blanket. It did not take long before she stretched her legs out, feeling hot.\nHuo Zheng carefully pulled the blanket down a little so she was not tightly bound. As he expected, she began to feel cold in fewer than two minutes. He waited calmly for a while.\nLin Xiaowan, who was cold, did not reach out for the blanket. Instead, she instinctively moved closer to the source of heat next to her while she was asleep.\nWith that, Huo Zheng hugged her, feeling satisfied.\n\u2026\nLin Xiaowan slept until 3.30 PM. When she woke up, Huo Zheng was already working.\nLate in the afternoon when it was almost time to get off work, Doctor Zhang finally came over and said the words that Lin Xiaowan wanted to hear most. She could finally be discharged.\nDoctor Zhang smiled. \u201cAre you very happy? However, after you\u2019re discharged, you must continue to take your medications. The weather is cold so you have to stay warm. It\u2019s dry during winter so make sure to stay hydrated. Eat more vegetables and fruits.\u201d\nDoctor Zhang looked at Huo Zheng before he continued to say, \u201cI\u2019ve looked at the results. She\u2019s just a little lacking in nutrition. It\u2019s important for her to have a balanced diet. It\u2019s nothing serious. Just pay attention to her diet.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s right. She needs to take more calcium supplements. The calcium deficiency is quite obvious.\u201d\nAfter giving a few more instructions, Doctor Zhang said that Lin Xiaowan could be discharged the next morning.\n\u2026\nHuo Zheng followed Doctor Zhang into the hallway.\nAfter walking for a while, Doctor Zhang said, \u201cMr. Huo, I know what you want to ask. The damage has been done. Although the chances aren\u2019t high, it\u2019s still possible for the patient to get pregnant.\u201d\nAfter Lin Xiaowan was rescued, Doctor Zhang had already mentioned this. However, Huo Zheng had yet to find a chance to mention it to Lin Xiaowan. Earlier, Doctor Zhang also did not maintain anything about this. Now that Lin Xiaowan was about to be discharged, he wanted to know if there was any improvement. However, after listening to Doctor Zhang\u2019s words, he no longer asked any questions.\nIn fact, it did not matter if Lin Xiaowan could not have children. Huo Zheng did not place much importance on having children. However, he knew Lin Xiaowan liked children and would definitely want children of her own in the future. He was afraid that she would be depressed once she found out about her condition. Fortunately, it was not completely impossible for her to have children; it was just that the chances were lower.\n\u2026\nOn the day Lin Xiaowan was discharged, Qiao You\u2019an brought Huang Dabao and Huang Erbao, who were on winter break, to pick Lin Xiaowan up.\nThe two children had not seen Lin Xiaowan for months and were excited to see her. They ran toward her as soon as they saw her.\n\u201cSister Xiaowan!\u201d\nAlthough the two children were young, they were as strong as wolf cubs. Huo Zheng was worried that they did not know how to control their strength. It was fine if they bumped into him, but what if they bumped into Lin Xiaowan? He quickly moved to stand in front of Lin Xiaowan and said sternly, \u201cDon\u2019t run.\u201d\nHuo Zheng had always been serious with the two children. They were naturally afraid of him. They stopped running immediately and said in unison, \u201cOkay.\u201d\nThen, Huo Zheng corrected the way the two children addressed Lin Xiaowan. He said, \u201cCall her \u2018Aunty\u2019.\u201d\nThe two children always addressed him as \u2018Uncle\u2019, but they always addressed Lin Xiaowan as \u2018Sister\u2019. He had corrected them many times, but they always forgot about it. He was determined to change their bad habits of messing up the order of seniority.\nOnly when the two children addressed Lin Xiaowan correctly did Huo Zheng allow them to hold Lin Xiaowan\u2019s hands.\nMeanwhile, Qiao You\u2019an only shook her head, finding the situation funny.\nAfter that, they returned to the Huo family\u2019s old residence. They had already discussed this beforehand.\nThere were many people in the old residence. Qiao You\u2019an and the two children were also staying there during the children\u2019s winter break. With so many people around to take care of Lin Xiaowan, she would not be lonely.\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

He was supposed to go for an annual inspection this month, but due to Lin Xiaowan\u2019s current condition, he was reluctant to leave and arranged for someone to go in his place. However, his workload did not decrease at all.\nIn the past, when Huo Zheng was very busy, he would not contact Lin Xiaowan at all. When she wanted to text or call him, she would hold back, worried that she would disturb him. He naturally was unaware of this.\nHowever, things were different now.\nLin Xiaowan was usually still asleep when Huo Zheng left in the morning. He would call her when he arrived at the company to wake her up for breakfast. He would remind her to drink a glass of hot milk and not to dawdle until breakfast grew cold. He noticed that she had a habit of waiting until the meal was cold before she ate.\nWhen Lin Xiaowan woke up, she would take a photo, send him a message, and tell him about what she had eaten. She would also share bits and pieces of her daily life with him.\nHuo Zheng would only reply to her occasionally when he was busy. They would chat intermittently throughout the day.\n\u2026\nToday, Huo Zheng returned early. When he walked into the living room, he could smell the fragrance of all kinds of food. A round plate with many spicy sticks sat on the table.\nAt this moment, Lin Xiaowan, Huang Dabao, and Huang Erbao were sitting on the carpeted floor and eating spicy sticks while they watched an old cartoon.\nHuo Zheng\u2019s vein throbbed on his forehead. \u2018Who gave her these?\u2019\nAt this moment, Huo Cheng walked over with a plate of fried snacks. When he saw Huo Zheng, he asked, \u201cWhy did you return so early today?\u201d\nWhen Huo Cheng set the plate down on the table, Huo Zheng saw French fries and fried chicken wings. He could not identify the other fried snacks.\nLin Xiaowan picked\u00a0up a piece of soft fried pork and stuffed it into her mouth. When she looked up and saw Huo Zheng standing nearby, she felt guilty even though his expression did not change. She quickly looked away as she thought to herself, \u2018Out of sight, out of mind.\u2019\nAt this moment, Huo Dabao stood up, wiped his hands, and ran to the kitchen to get some dipping sauce.\n\u201cWhy are you eating these things? Have you drunk water?\u201d\nHuo Zheng felt a headache coming on.\nLin Xiaowan wiped her hands and raised a water bottle for him to see as she said, \u201cI already drank four times today.\u201d\nThe water bottle displayed the measurement of the water inside. It could hold up to 550 milliliters of water. Lin Xiaowan felt that she had drunk a lot of water considering it was winter.\n\u201cToo little.\u201d\n\nAt this time, Qiao You\u2019an walked out with Huang Dabao, helping him bring a few different dipping sauces over. When she saw Huo Zheng standing while looking at Lin Xiaowan, who clearly looked aggrieved, she asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\n\u201cHe won\u2019t let me eat any more of the snacks.\u201d\nQiao You\u2019an spoke up for Lin Xiaowan immediately. \u201cIt\u2019s fine to eat a little. The spicy sticks and snacks were homemade, and we only made a small portion. There\u2019s not much after sharing it with the children.\u201d\nHuo Zheng frowned. He was about to speak again when his sister-in-law interjected, \u201cI called the doctor and asked. He said it\u2019s okay.\u201d\nWith this, Huo Zheng could not say anything more and only asked Lin Xiaowan to drink more water.\n\u2026\nDuring dinner, Huo Zheng asked if Lin Xiaowan wanted to accompany him to the Huo Corporation\u2019s annual banquet, which would take place the day after tomorrow. He had thought about this matter a lot. Previously, Huo Cheng pointed out that he had never brought Lin Xiaowan to any events. As a result, many rumors were swirling outside. This time, he planned to bring Lin Xiaowan with him to put the rumors to a stop.\nIn the past, Lin Xiaowan did not want to attend these events. Huo Zheng respected her wishes and did not force her. It was fine if she did not want to go. Moreover, he usually did not stay for long and would leave after a while.\nCurrently, Lin Xiaowan had also changed. She wanted to try and enter Huo Zheng\u2019s world as well. She asked, \u201cWhere is it? Do I have to dress formally?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Huo Zheng replied, \u201cI have a year-end staff meeting in the afternoon. The banquet starts at six. I\u2019ll pick you up before six?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I\u2019ll come to you. It\u2019s too troublesome for you to go back and forth,\u201d Lin Xiaowan said.\nThe old residence was very far from the company, and it would take Huo Zheng almost two hours to come and go.\n\u201cI\u2019ll get the driver to pick you up!\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Lin Xiaowan replied with a nod.\nLin Xiaowan had never attended a company\u2019s annual banquet before. She had never even attended a gathering with friends, let alone a company gathering. She could not help but ask curiously, \u201cWhat happens during the banquet?\u201d\n\u201cNothing much. There are performances and a lucky draw.\u201d\n\u2026\nOn the day of the banquet.\nWhen Lin Xiaowan woke up from her afternoon nap, Huo Zheng\u2019s driver was already waiting for her.\nQiao You\u2019an helped Lin Xiaowan pick out her outfit and put her hair up in a very pretty style. She said with a smile, \u201cYou look beautiful. Have fun tonight.\u201d\n\nLin Xiaowan wore a pink down jacket over her dress and wore black over-the-knee boots that made her legs look slender and long. She wore a pair of golden tassel earrings that hung down. She also wore light makeup, making her look exquisite.\nLin Xiaowan asked nervously before she left, \u201cAm I dressed too casually?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine. Most people are dressed casually as well. The event is for people to relax and socialize. You don\u2019t have to worry about anything later. Just eat, drink, and watch the performances,\u201d Qiao You\u2019an said patiently, \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to stay with Huo Zheng, you can walk around. I\u2019m sure there\u2019ll be a buffet table in Marles\u2019 banquet hall. You can try to make friends or do whatever you want.\u201d\n\u2026\nThe Marles Hotel was the venue of the company\u2019s annual banquet, and it was located in the heart of the city.\nWhen the driver pulled to a stop in front of the entrance, Lin Xiaowan saw Huo Zheng waiting for her with a smile on his face. She got off the car and rushed to him.\n\u201cHuo Zheng!\u201d\nHuo Zheng caught her in his arms and caressed her head. The heater was turned on in the car so she was warm.\nEver since Lin Xiaowan was injured, her hands and feet were cold. At night, he would sit in the living room with her while she soak her feet in hot water. He planned to look for a traditional Chinese doctor to examine her after she stopped taking her medications.\n\u201cGood evening, Young Madam.\u201d\nAt this moment, Huo Zheng\u2019s assistant stood at the side. He was the one whom Huo Zheng often instructed to buy gifts like clothes, jewelry, bags, and shoes for Lin Xiaowan. As such, he was naturally familiar with Lin Xiaowan.\nThe way the assistant addressed Lin Xiaowan was a little different. After marrying into the Huo family, Qiao You\u2019an had always been addressed as Madam. Later on, Huo Zheng brought Lin Xiaowan back, and there were two Madams in the Huo family. To differentiate the two, the assistant addressed Lin Xiaowan as \u2018Young Madam\u2019 since she was a little younger.\nAlthough it was said that Huo Zheng was in the stage of pursuing Lin Xiaowan, she did not shy away from this title at all. She politely greeted, \u201cGood evening, Assistant Song.\u201d\n\u2026\nThe banquet hall was located on the sixth floor. As Huo Zheng led his subordinates to the elevator, he asked, \u201cDidn\u2019t you say you want to address me as \u2018Brother\u2019?\u201d\nHuo Zheng\u2019s voice was not low, and there were many people coming and going at this time.\nLin Xiaowan looked around before she said with a burning face, \u201cWhy did you say it so loudly?\u201d\nIt was fine when no one was around, but she felt embarrassed now that there were others around even though there was nothing strange about the word \u2018Brother\u2019.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s there to be embarrassed about?\u201d Huo Zheng asked teasingly.\nThe banquet had yet to start. Many employees had just arrived after the year-end meeting.\nWhen the elevator door slid open, many people\u2019s attention were instantly drawn to Huo Zheng and Lin Xiaowan as soon as they stepped out.\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

As she had lived with her grandmother in Northern City since she was young, she would always be pointed at and gossiped about whenever she went out. Although she knew that the people who were looking at them here were only gossiping, it was torturous for Lin Xiaowan.\nShe was afraid that people were talking bad about her, even though they were strangers.\nHowever, she still felt uncomfortable. She held Huo Zheng\u2019s hand tightly and wanted to run away.\nThe man glanced around expressionlessly. His eyes were dignified without anger. Those who worked in the Huo Corporation were afraid of being remembered by the big boss. If they were fired the next day because they had one foot in the company first, they would quickly look away and pretend to talk to the people beside them.\nHe looked straight ahead and led them around a corner, disappearing into the corridor.\nThe people on the floor craned their necks and started gossiping.\n\u201cThis is our Lady Boss? I\u2019ve long heard that we have a lady boss, but I didn\u2019t expect it to be a young lady! I thought she would be a good wife and loving mother, hahahaha.\u201d\n\u201cYour skin is so fair. You look a little introverted.\u201d\n\u201cD * mn, is this underage? It looked so small. As expected, men liked young women. Tsk tsk tsk tsk.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Are you envious? Even if you\u2019re envious, you should still look for one. With the big boss\u2019s looks and wealth, it\u2019s not strange for him to find any kind of person.\u201d\nThe person who spoke just now hammered another person.\u201dI\u2019m just saying, so what if she\u2019s young? I don\u2019t like her. I have a wife and a family. Why wouldn\u2019t I like my wife?\u201d\n\u201cAiya, but the lady boss looks so cute. I\u2019m a girl who likes her so much.\u201d\nHuo Zheng led his men to the lounge first.\nThe cold and dignified big boss now lowered his eyes and said to the little girl beside him with a gentle expression,\u201dIf you feel uncomfortable, we won\u2019t go.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan felt a little embarrassed and muttered softly,\u201d\u201dCome, come, come, come, come\u201d\nOne of the virtues of the people of Shangxia was that they were already here.\n\u201cDon\u2019t be nervous,\u201d Huo Zheng said with a smile.\u201dPeople are just curious.\u201d\u201d\n\nLin Xiaowan could understand. After all, a high and mighty big boss suddenly brought a female companion over. If she were to be a bystander, she would also take a few more glances.\nHe might even have to tell the people around him,\u201dLook, the big boss actually brought a female companion.\u201d\nShe wasn\u2019t worried about these discussions. She was just afraid that people wouldn\u2019t like her, think that she and Huo Zheng weren\u2019t compatible, and secretly badmouth her.\nNo malicious speculations!\nLin Xiaowan didn\u2019t allow herself to think any further and forced herself to stop thinking.\nShe didn\u2019t want to be with Huo Zheng. No matter where he went, he would always be the center of attention. It was too stressful to be with him.\nHuo Zheng checked her phone\u2019s battery and signal.\u201dCall me if there\u2019s anything, or come find me. Stay on this floor and don\u2019t run around, understand?\u201d\n\u201cI know. I\u2019m not a three-year-old child.\u201d\nHuo Zheng scratched the tip of her nose.\u201dYou\u2019re not as obedient as a child.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan didn\u2019t bring her bag today. She bounced away after putting her phone away.\nApart from the formal banquet, there was also a buffet table next to the banquet hall. Lin Xiaowan was holding a small white porcelain plate as she ate and drank.\nThe stage area could also be clearly seen from this side. On the stage, there were a few long-legged sisters who were showing off their beautiful figures dancing, causing a wave of cheers. The venue was very lively. No matter where everyone sat, there were many people holding wine glasses and walking around to exchange greetings and toast.\nThere was a roasted duck table with freshly freshly sliced and rolled ducks. There was no one around, so she just stood there. The auntie rolled one and she ate one. The auntie was so happy that she fed the duck enthusiastically and even asked her to go to the side to get a cup to get something to drink.\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you eat at the banquet? The boss of your company is really rich. Today\u2019s menu is full of big dishes.\u201dThe auntie asked her.\nThe banquet was held at a round table. She didn\u2019t know anyone, so she was afraid that it would be awkward if others asked her about it, or if they had seen her and Huo Zheng together. If they met again, she didn\u2019t know what to say.\nAnyway, there were soft Changsha and banquet chairs to sit on. Moreover, there were also people from the company chatting in twos and threes here, so she was not out of the ordinary.\nLin Xiaowan didn\u2019t tell the truth. She smiled and said,\u201d\u201dI don\u2019t want to go over.\u201d\nThere were no more shredded green onions, so the auntie went to the kitchen to cut some new green onions. Lin Xiaowan didn\u2019t stand there and wait. She walked around and passed the useless plate to the waiter. Then, she used a small teacup to fill two ice cream balls.\n\nIt had been a long time since he had experienced the feeling of eating whatever he wanted!\nWhen he walked back, he saw a girl holding a wine glass standing at the front of the stage.\nThe girl\u2019s face was a little red, probably because she had drunk alcohol. She was very familiar with him.\u201dAre you here to eat roast duck too? The roast duck was really not bad! The skin is especially crispy.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan was too embarrassed to say that she had been eating here for half a day.\nThe girl saw the ice cream ball in her hand and asked,\u201dWhere did you get this? I want to eat too.\u201d\n\u201cOver there.\u201d Lin Xiaowan pointed and saw that the ice-cream bucket in the freezer didn\u2019t seem too obvious. She said,\u201d Let me bring you there?\u201d\n\u201cOkay.\u201d\nAs they walked, the girl chatted with Lin Xiaowan. She hadn\u2019t been working at the Huo Corporation for long and thought that Lin Xiaowan was also an employee of the Huo Corporation.\u201dAre you also an employee of the headquarters? I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen you before.\u201d\nWhenever a topic that she didn\u2019t know how to answer appeared, Lin Xiaowan would choose to giggle and change the topic.\nShe thought that strictly speaking, she should be considered a family member, right?\nAlthough Huo Zheng was still chasing after her, he could be considered as half a family member. Anyway, if nothing unexpected happened, she would probably always be with Huo Zheng.\nThe girl didn\u2019t really want to find out about her background. She asked casually and started gossiping.\u201dI heard that the big boss came today with his wife. Have you seen her?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan\u2019s heart skipped a beat from the sudden question. She carefully sized up the girl beside her.\u201dHave you seen it?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I came a little late. Sigh, my colleague said that I came a little late with the big boss and the lady boss.\u201d\nPhew, it was still alright. Lin Xiaowan heaved a sigh of relief and said briskly,\u201d\u201dI didn\u2019t see it either.\u201d\n\u201cI heard that the lady boss is very good-looking. I wonder if I will have the chance to see her tonight. I\u2019m looking forward to it.\u201d\nThe girl leaned closer to Lin Xiaowan and whispered to her,\u201d\u201dLet me tell you, quite a few people who saw the lady boss thought that the boss was an old cow eating young grass. Hahahahahaha. The lady boss looked at the little girl.\u201d\n\u201cAh, I don\u2019t think so\u2026The boss is only 25 or 26 years old this year.\u201dLin Xiaowan silently spoke up for Huo Zheng.\u201d That girl must at least, um\u2026You must have graduated from university.\u201d\nThe age difference between them was really very small! There was no generation gap!\nThe girl looked at him in surprise.\u201d This must be fake news. Did you see the scandal reported by the marketing account a long time ago? The one who brought the photo and said she was getting married. That scandal has long been refuted by our group\u2019s legal department. The other party is just a scheming woman who wants to climb up the rich and powerful.\u201d\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

Aren\u2019t you curious?\u201d\nThe young woman scooped a bowl of ice cream for herself and stood at the side. She continued to chat as she ate.\n\u201cMoreover, what does it matter if we like her or not? She\u2019s the boss\u2019 wife, not ours.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m curious as well,\u201d Lin Xiaowan said with a straight face and nodded. Then, she spared no effort in smearing herself as she continued to say, \u201cHowever, I don\u2019t think she\u2019s compatible with the boss. I heard that she doesn\u2019t know anything. She\u2019s not a young miss from a prominent family. She\u2019s just an ordinary person and doesn\u2019t even have a job. She spends the boss\u2019 money every day and relies on him to support her.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re so strange. You\u2019ve never seen her before, but why does it seem like you dislike her?\u201d the young woman asked, raising an eyebrow. Then, she thought about it for a few seconds before her eyes widened and her face paled. She asked, \u201cDon\u2019t you tell me you have a crush on the boss?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan hurriedly waved her hands and shook her head frantically to deny those words. \u201cNo, no, no! I\u2019ve never even met the boss. How could I have a crush on him? I only heard those things from someone else.\u201d\n\u201cOh, then that person must be jealous and deliberately said bad things about the boss\u2019 wife. What\u2019s wrong with her spending the boss\u2019 money? She\u2019s so beautiful so she should spend money beautifully as well\u2026\u201d the young woman said. Then, she added with a disdainful expression, \u201cLet me tell you. Although I\u2019ve just started working at the company recently, there are always people who don\u2019t know their places and dream about marrying into a rich family. Those women are the most annoying. They belittle and trample on people of their own gender just to attract the attention of the opposite sex. That person who told you this must be making up lies before she\u2019s jealous. Women should always get along with each other.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan gave the young woman a thumbs up and said, \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d\n\u2026\nAfter a while, the lucky draw was finally about to take place on the stage. The young woman wanted to see if she would win so she bade farewell to Lin Xiaowan. However, seeing that Lin Xiaowan seemed to have nowhere to go, she invited Lin Xiaowan to the table.\nLin Xiaowan politely declined the invitation.\nThe young woman said, looking slightly disappointed, \u201cAlright. By the way, which department are you from? You look very young. Perhaps, we can have a meal together when we\u2019re free.\u201d\n\nLin Xiaowan naturally did not know about the departments in Huo Zheng\u2019s company. She had never even been to the company before. Hence, she could only laugh it off and say, \u201cI\u2019m not telling you.\u201d\nAfter that, Lin Xiaowan continued to eat for a while more before she returned to the lounge where Huo Zheng had shown her earlier.\nHuo Zheng was not around, but as soon as Lin Xiaowan entered, a waiter pushed a small cart in and brought a fruit plate to her.\nLin Xiaowan continued to eat. When she finally brought her phone out, she discovered that it was almost 8 PM.\nWhen Huo Zheng finally came to the lounge, Lin Xiaowan was lying on the couch watching a variety show, giggling to herself. When she saw him, she paused the show and quickly got up.\n\u201cYou\u2019re finally here. Where were you?\u201d\nHuo Zheng had to go on stage to present the gifts for the lucky draw.\nLin Xiaowan had taken off her down jacket earlier, and she was only wearing a cashmere sweater now. Huo Zheng reached into her sweater and felt her round stomach. He asked gently, \u201cWhat did you eat?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan did not always enforce the rule of \u2018You\u2019re pursuing me so don\u2019t stick so close to me\u2019. At this moment, she felt very comfortable when he rubbed her stomach so she did not say anything. She burped twice happily.\n\u201cI ate a lot of delicious food.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan naturally did not go into details. There were many, many things that Huo Zheng prevented her from eating after she was hospitalized.\nIn her previous life, Huo Zheng never cared about such trivial matters. She was free to do as she wanted and ate whatever she wanted whenever she wanted. However, she could not do that now.\nWhen he was at home, how much she could drink also depended on him. She thought that it was a little too much. The juice was freshly squeezed. There were no additives at all. Was it any different from eating fruits?\nNonetheless, Lin Xiaowan also enjoyed his care. Although she would occasionally protest a little and eat when he was not looking, she still liked it.\nLin Xiaowan said smugly, \u201cI met your employees. They like me very much. They said that I\u2019m especially good-looking.\u201d\nHer words were a little exaggerated. She did not meet his employees; she only met one of his employees. Nonetheless, it did not stop her from showing off happily.\n\u201cEveryone says I\u2019m too good for you!\u201d\n\nHuo Zheng chuckled and did not comment on her words.\nLin Xiaowan fisted her hand and pretended to hold a microphone to Huo Zheng\u2019s mouth before she asked, \u201cDo you have any comments regarding your employees\u2019 words?\u201d\nHuo Zheng held her hand and said, \u201cThey\u2019re right. Miss Lin is too good for me.\u201d\nHis voice was low and magnetic, and it carried a hint of joy, making Lin Xiaowan\u2019s heart melt.\n\u2026\nIn a blink of an eye, it was already the eve of the lunar new year.\nEveryone in the old residence was on vacation, and after having early lunch, they discussed what dumplings to make for dinner. They decided to make a few sweet dumplings for good luck.\nThe Huo brothers and Qiao You\u2019an knew how to make dumplings, but Lin Xiaowan did not. Although she could wrap the fillings, the dumplings she made had very little fillings, and they were wrapped in such a way that they did not look like dumplings at all.\nHuo Cheng rolled the dough with a rolling pin and gave it to Lin Xiaowan and his two children to play with. The children, like Lin Xiaowan, did not know how to make dumplings.\nHuo Zheng learned how to make dumplings from his parents when he was young. Mrs. Huo loved dumplings so the family would always make dumplings together during the holidays.\nIn the beginning, when they got together, Lin Xiaowan had been very intrigued when she saw Huo Zheng making dumplings. She felt that it was rare that a tycoon like him was so adept at making dumplings. However, as time passed, she had gotten used to it.\nAfter making the dumplings, they put them aside and only planned to cook them after midnight.\nHuo Cheng brought the children to the courtyard to set off fireworks.\nHuo Zheng was worried that Lin Xiaowan would stand too close to the fireworks so he planned to accompany her. However, he was stopped by Qiao You\u2019an.\nWhen everyone left, Huo Zheng looked at his sister-in-law and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\nQiao You\u2019an wanted to speak to Huo Zheng about persuading Lin Xiaowan to make friends and get hobbies of her own. She said, \u201cI don\u2019t think she has any goals in life. She\u2019s always revolving around you and doesn\u2019t have her own life at all.\u201d\nIn Qiao You\u2019an\u2019s opinion, a person should live for themselves, not solely for others.\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

How can you just say that it\u2019s fine? How can you be like this as her fath\u2026\u201d Qiao You\u2019an coughed and corrected her words, \u201cHow can you be like this as her boyfriend?\u201d\nQiao You\u2019an was so used to talking to her children and her husband that she almost said the word \u2018father\u2019.\nHuo Zheng understood Qiao You\u2019an cared about Lin Xiaowan\u2019s well being so he said, \u201cThank you, Sister-in-law.\u201d\nQiao You\u2019an nodded and did not continue on that topic. Instead, she asked, \u201cHey, can you help take care of Dabao and Erbao for a few days after the new year?\u201d\nHuo Cheng would only start work after the 15th of the first lunar month. Hence, the couple would usually leave their children behind and spend some time alone. It was the same the summer Huo Zheng met Lin Xiaowan.\nApart from Huo Zheng, usually the nanny would also help take care of the children.\n\u201c\u2026 Alright.\u201d\n\u2026\nHuo Cheng and Qiao You\u2019an left on the second day of the lunar new year. They took the children to visit the Qiao family\u2019s house in the morning before they left on a plane at night.\nWhen Huo Daobao and Huo Erbao woke up in the morning and could not find their parents, they did not cry. After changing their clothes, they held hands and went for breakfast.\nSome employees in the Huo family\u2019s old residence had also returned to work.\nHuo Zheng had just brought a bowl of white fungus porridges out of the kitchen when he saw the two brothers yawning as they walked in. He praised expressionlessly, \u201cYou did well changing your clothes.\u201d\nThe nanny who had taken care of the two children since they were young quickly brought them away to wash their faces and brush their teeth.\nHuo Zheng carried the bowl of porridge upstairs into the bedroom.\nAlthough the double curtains had been drawn, Lin Xiaowan was still sleeping with her face buried in the blanket.\nHuo Zheng tested the temperature of the porridge before he placed it on the coffee table. After that, he went to the bathroom to wet a towel with warm water before he gently woke Lin Xiaowan up and wiped her face.\nLin Xiaowan went to bed a little late last night. After a long time of not being together, Huo Zheng had coaxed her gently and convinced her to sleep with him. He was successful in his quest. After the deed was done, she had complained, saying that she would not give him a chance to pursue her anymore and blaming him for going overboard.\nHuo Zheng had found it funny at that time. He hugged her waist and kissed her before he said, \u201cDidn\u2019t you say that I was too restrained and reserved before this?\u201d\n\nLin Xiaowan bit him angrily, thinking that the man next to her was extremely annoying.\n\u2018He didn\u2019t even manage to adhere to the rule of no kissing and no hugging for long! B*stard!\u2019\nLin Xiaowan was still in a bad mood after Huo Zheng woke her up. She ate the porridge and expressed her dissatisfaction.\n\u201cYou said you were going to pursue me, but you didn\u2019t pursue me at all! How could you do\u2026 that\u2026 when you\u2019re still pursuing me? That\u2019s something only couples do!\u201d\n\u201cAren\u2019t we a couple?\u201d Huo Zheng asked, pretending to raise his eyebrows in surprise, \u201cWe\u2019re wearing our rings after all.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan was shocked by his shamelessness. \u201cWhy are you like this? You\u2019re the one who said I couldn\u2019t take it off!\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s because we\u2019re a couple!\u201d\nLin Xiaowan was rendered speechless by his words. After a while, she reached out and pinched Huo Zheng\u2019s face and asked, \u201cDid your soul get replaced? You never used to talk like this.\u201d\nIn the past, if this happened, Huo Zheng would listen to her complain in silence before he replied with an \u2018Okay. I\u2019ll pursue you after this.\u2019\nHuo Zheng cleared his throat and asked, \u201cDon\u2019t you like it this way?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t slander me. When did I say such a thing?\u201d Lin Xiaowan said. She tried to recall, but she could not remember when she had said such things. However, when she pressed him again, she was only met with silence.\nLin Xiaowan was speechless.\n\u2018You changed so quickly?\u2019\n\u201cA-anyway\u2026 It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t like it,\u201d Lin Xiaowan said. Then, she took another bite before she said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to eat anymore.\u201d\nHuo Zheng finished her leftovers and remained silent.\nA thought appeared in Lin Xiaowan\u2019s mind at this moment. She grabbed his arm and asked, \u201cIs it because I said you were very different when you were with Song Zhiyi?\u201d\nHuo Zheng only looked at her silently. However, his gaze told her that she had guessed correctly.\nLin Xiaowan smiled, feeling that he was a little cute. She said, \u201cI like you like this. I didn\u2019t say that I didn\u2019t like it. I like that you openly show me affection. Song Zhiyi said that you\u2019re childish and clingy, but I don\u2019t think so. I like you being clingy, and occasionally, there\u2019s nothing wrong with being childish.\u201d\nHuo Zheng finally replied, \u201cHmm.\u201d\nWorried that he would feel pressured, Lin Xiaowan added, \u201cActually, if you don\u2019t want to change, you don\u2019t have to change. I\u2019m not saying you have to be as passionate and enthusiastic as you used to be. I just want you to express your love for me instead of keeping quiet and letting me guess your thoughts. It\u2019s very tiring having to constantly guess another person\u2019s thoughts.\u201d\n\nLin Xiaowan reached out to hug him and said, \u201cJust be yourself.\u201d\nHuo Zheng returned the hug and said, \u201cOkay.\u201d\n\u201cI like it when you show me affection,\u201d Lin Xiaowan said truthfully, \u201cSo\u2026 So don\u2019t always leave me guessing whether you love me or not. Do you understand?\u201d\nHuo Zheng lowered his head and kissed her. Then, he pulled away and whispered, \u201cI love you.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan panted slightly after the kiss. It took a while for her to recover her breath before she leaned against him and said, \u201cBut you still have to pursue me.\u201d\nHuo Zheng nodded and kissed her again.\n\u2026\nOn the night of the seventh day of the lunar new year.\nQiao You\u2019an video-called her sons. When she was done talking to them, she asked to speak to Lin Xiaowan.\nHuo Dabao passed the tablet to Lin Xiaowan, who was fiddling with her architectural model before he helped her with the model.\nLin Xiaowan adjusted the tablet and found a flattering angle before she asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Sister?\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s something I need to trouble you with.\u201d\nHuang Dabao and Huang Erbao were in the same class, and there was a parent committee in the class. A few parents decided to organize a gathering and invited Qiao You\u2019an out to plan the gathering.\nQiao You\u2019an was usually participate in such things, but children like playing together. As such, she would not refuse a chance for the children to play together.\nMost parents naturally did not want their children to lose at the starting line. Apart from studying and attending classes, the children spent time in cram schools and also various activities. With their \u2018elite\u2019 education, there was almost no time for them to play.\nLin Xiaowan was a little nervous. \u201cAh, but I have never participated in this kind of parent-child activity before.\u201d\nQiao You\u2019an laughed. \u201cI\u2019m not asking you to attend on my behalf. I just want you to attend a meeting with them to discuss the venue and things to buy. You just need to listen to them and tell me about it; I\u2019ll deal with everything after that. Oh, remember to take note of the expenses as well.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan finally understood Qiao You\u2019an\u2019s meaning. After a while, she asked curiously, \u201cWhat do you usually do at such gatherings?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s different every time,\u201d Qiao You\u2019an replied, \u201cOne summer, there was a play by the children. There was also one time when we played parent-child games to develop the children\u2019s potential\u2026 When the children were in first grade, we went on a camping trip.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan was amazed. When she was in school, she only studied and went home. When she was in junior high school, she worked part-time. There was nothing worth remembering during her years in school.\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly. Thank you so much!\n\n", "37": "https://novellive.com/book/becoming-a-wealthy-familys-beloved-after-her-rebirth/chapter-37\n\nThe parents had an afternoon tea appointment.\nQiao You\u2019an temporarily added Lin Xiaowan to the parents\u2019 group chat. After receiving the address, Lin Xiaowan quickly searched it up. She saw that the place had a high rating of 4.9 stars.\nLin Xiaowan looked at the menu and saw many exquisite drinks and desserts. The desserts were beautiful with unsurprisingly high prices. A slice of Black Forest cake that usually sold for 50 or 60 yuan was sold for 128 yuan in the shop.\nLin Xiaowan thought to herself, \u2018It\u2019s really easy to earn money from rich people\u2026\u2019\n\u2026\nIt was a little cloudy on the day of the meeting. It was snowing lightly, and it was windy outside. It seemed like it would snow heavily later.\nHuo Zheng called Lin Xiaowan from the company and said, \u201cRemember to wear more layers. Tell the driver to wait for you there. Don\u2019t come back too late.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan was dressed warmly. She sat on the low stool by the door to change her shoes. It was a little strenuous for her to bend over to change her shoes due to how thick her clothes were. She said, \u201cI know.\u201d\n\u201cWill you be coming back for dinner?\u201d\n\u201cI think so? They said they were meeting for afternoon tea and didn\u2019t say anything about having dinner.\u201d\nHuo Zheng nodded. \u201cDon\u2019t eat too many snacks. Otherwise, if you don\u2019t have an appetite for dinner, I\u2019ll punish you.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan agreed and ended the call.\nOn the night of the annual banquet, Lin Xiaowan ate a little too much so she had slight indigestion and flatulence. At that time, Huo Zheng did not say much, but his expression was a little bad. Later, when they were going to bed, he used this matter as an excuse to \u2018punish\u2019 her.\n\u2026\nThe meeting with the parents was surprisingly smooth. The people who came were all mothers. Perhaps, due to Lin Xiaowan\u2019s young age, everyone was very tolerant and kind. They spoke very gently, making her feel quite comfortable when interacting with them. One of the mothers even brought her daughter along.\nWhile they planned the gathering, Lin Xiaowan listened while she ate the desserts.\n\nOne woman, who was clearly the leader, said, \u201cThen, why don\u2019t we organize for the children to watch a musical? We can make some snacks and glutinous rice balls ourselves.\u201d\nThe woman looked very much like the image of a successful person. She was dressed in a well-fitted suit, and her hair was pulled up into a high ponytail.\nSeeing how the other party took charge, Lin Xiaowan speculated that the other party worked in upper management for a company.\nAfter everyone agreed, Lin Xiaowan nodded along. She sent Qiao You\u2019an a message, detailing the result of the meeting. Then, she bit her fork and asked curiously, \u201cAre you going to the theater to watch the children\u2019s musical?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll book a venue and invite the cast over. They\u2019ll deal with everything after that,\u201d a woman replied.\nLin Xiaowan nodded. \u2018As expected, they\u2019re really rich\u2026\u2019\nNearing the end of the meeting, there was a small incident.\nThe mother who brought her daughter along was flustered when her daughter suddenly woke up from her nap and began to cry loudly. No matter how hard she tried to coax her daughter, her daughter did not stop crying.\nThe mother, who looked like a successful career woman, said, looking slightly unhappy, \u201cI really don\u2019t understand you. If it\u2019s inconvenient for you to come today because of your child, you could\u2019ve just stayed home. Why did you have to force yourself to come?\u201d\nThe mother, who brought her daughter along, continued to coax her child and apologize profusely at the same time. She was clearly flustered and at a loss as she coaxed her child in a soft but stiff voice.\nAt this moment, a mother, who was a young and beautiful model, looked at the other woman busy coaxing her child with little effect before she chimed in, \u201cFortunately, Aubrey\u2019s mother booked a private room today. Otherwise, if we were outside, the other patrons would definitely complain about the noise.\u201d\n\u2018Aubrey\u2019s mother?\u2019\nLin Xiaowan had been sitting here the entire afternoon, but she still did not know much about these mothers and their children.\nAt this moment, the mother brought out a milk bottle from her bag and tested the temperature. A long time had passed since she arrived so the milk had already gone cold. Needless to say, she could not give the cold milk to her daughter.\nSeeing that the others were frowning and looking at her unhappily, the mother was at a loss. In the end, she quickly rose to her feet with her daughter in her arms and tried to coax her daughter to sleep again. She lowered her head and said humbly, \u201cI\u2019m really sorry. I\u2019ll carry her to the side and coax her. All of you can continue.\u201d\nHowever, some of the mothers were still unhappy.\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you carry her outside to coax her instead? She\u2019s too noisy. We won\u2019t be to hear ourselves. How are we going to continue?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m really sorry.\u201d\nThe mother touched her daughter\u2019s diaper. It was a little heavy so she guessed that her daughter must have pooped or peed. She had new diapers in her bag, and there was a couch in the private room. However, it was obvious that she could not change her daughter\u2019s diaper in the room.\nThe other mothers were clearly unhappy with her. They looked at her coldly and did not offer to help her.\nThe mother became even more anxious and embarrassed when she felt the cold gazes. She also began to regret attending the meeting and wondered why she was so insistent about attending it.\nLin Xiaowan had never seen anyone coaxing a baby before and did not understand much. However, when she saw the mother keep glancing at the milk bottle on her seat, she asked, \u201cIs she hungry?\u201d\nThe mother walked back and forth with the baby in her arms. She did not want to go outside since it would attract even more attention. She looked a little like she was going to cry as she replied, \u201cMaybe, but the milk has gone cold.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan had never given birth before and had never taken care of babies before. As such, she was not sure of the correct way to heat up milk for babies. She glanced at the mothers and found all of them wore unhappy expressions on their faces and had no intention of helping at all. She suddenly felt that the mother holding her daughter was a little pitiful. She finally mustered up her courage and said, \u201cThen I\u2019ll ask a waiter to help you heat it up.\u201d\nIf Lin Xiaowan were in that mother\u2019s shoes, she felt that she would definitely be sad as well if no one was willing to help her. She would probably be too traumatized to attend such meetings in the future.\nThe mother, who was holding her daughter, looked visibly relieved. She said earnestly, \u201cThank you, thank you!\u201d\nLin Xiaowan brought the milk bottle out and looked for a waiter. She explained the situation and also asked if there was a spare room. The waiter spoke to his supervisor before he led the mother and daughter to the staff lounge.\nLin Xiaowan followed them, helping the mother carry her bag of baby\u2019s supplies.\nAfter they left, the other mothers began to talk about Lin Xiaowan.\nThe beautiful mother who was a model asked, \u201cIs she also from the Huo family?\u201d\nWhen Qiao You\u2019an spoke to them, she only referred to Lin Xiaowan as her younger sister. However, they knew that Qiao You\u2019an was the youngest in her family.\nThe mother, who looked like a career woman, asked Qiao You\u2019an a few more questions compared to the others so she knew more than the others did. She said, \u201cShe has quite a high status. Hubert\u2019s mother said that she\u2019s the Second Young Madam of the Huo family. Apparently, Second Master Huo cares for her even more meticulously than the two little heirs of the Huo family.\u201d\nHubert was Huo Dabao\u2019s English name, and Hu Erbao\u2019s English name was Herman. They went to an international school so they were given English names. However, Huo Cheng and Qiao You\u2019an did not address their children by their English names, thinking that their children\u2019s nicknames, Dabao and Erbao, sounded more intimate. Their English names were only to make things convenient for their foreign teachers.\n\u201cIs that true? Why didn\u2019t I hear anything about the Second Young Master of the Huo family getting married?\u201d\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly. Thank you so much!\n\n", "38": "https://novellive.com/book/becoming-a-wealthy-familys-beloved-after-her-rebirth/chapter-38\n\nOne mother pushed another playfully and asked, \u201cWhy would the Huo family tell you anything if one of them got married?\u201d\n\u201cWhat nonsense are you saying? I was just curious.\u201d\nSomeone sighed and said, \u201cPut everything else aside, this Second Young Madam is really beautiful. Her posture when she sat and ate was quite good. I really want a daughter like her. Alas, I only have sons.\u201d\nThe beautiful mother, who was a model, said a little enviously, \u201cI was looking at her earlier. She ate so many desserts without any care in the world, but she\u2019s still so slim. I craved desserts just by watching her eat so happily.\u201d\nModels had to follow very strict diets to maintain their figures after all. She could only look at those desserts and did not dare to eat them at all.\nAfter this, the topic drifted to the mother who brought her young daughter here.\n\u201cI really don\u2019t know what to say about Mag\u2019s mother. Why would she bring her child here today? How did she plan to have afternoon tea in peace if she brought her child?\u201d\n\u201cShe doesn\u2019t have a nanny or helper at home. How could she not bring her child?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine if it happens once in a while, but she insists on coming and bringing her child every time. Who can stand such a thing?\u201d\n\u2026\nAfter the waiter brought Lin Xiaowan and the mother-and-daughter pair to the staff lounge, he helped heat up the milk and threw the dirty diaper away.\nThe mother thanked the waiter profusely. \u201cThank you, thank you so much. I\u2019m so sorry for the trouble.\u201d\nThe waiter did not take this matter to heart and replied, \u201cThis is what we should do.\u201d\nThe waiter kindly told them to take their time and reminded them not to touch the things in the room. However, there were surveillance cameras in the room so he was not worried about leaving people here unattended.\nLin Xiaowan nodded and thanked the waiter again.\nAfter the waiter left, the baby finally stopped crying. At this moment, she was obediently drinking milk in her mother\u2019s arms.\nThe mother was about to speak when Lin Xiaowan\u2019s phone suddenly rang. She said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I need to take this call.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan walked to the side and answered the call.\n\u201cHave you left?\u201d Huo Zheng asked in a low and gentle voice.\nLin Xiaowan looked at the time. It was already past five.\n\n\u201cNot yet. Are you done with your work?\u201d\n\u201cYes. I\u2019ll pick you up.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t. The traffic jam is terrible at this time. Go home first. I\u2019ll let you know when I\u2019m leaving.\u201d\n\u201cYou should leave soon. The weather is quite bad.\u201d\n\u201cI know. I\u2019ll leave soon.\u201d\nAfter Lin Xiaowan ended the call, the mother quickly said, \u201cThank you so much for today.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to thank me,\u201d Lin Xiaowan said, feeling a little guilty, \u201cI didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d\nAll she did was ask for the waiter\u2019s help.\nAfter that, Lin Xiaowan remembered she had left her bag in the private room. She told the mother that she was going to get her back and asked the other party if she wanted to return to the room.\nThe mother was reluctant to return to that place that made her uncomfortable. She shook her head and said, \u201cI\u2019ll stay here for a while and see if I can coax her to sleep.\u201d\n\u201cHow old is she?\u201d Lin Xiaowan asked casually.\n\u201cA little over seven months\u2026\nLin Xiaowan could not help but feel a little worried.\n\u2018Is it really okay to bring the baby out when she\u2019s so young?\u2019\n\u2026\nWhen Lin Xiaowan returned to the private room, the mothers had already finished their discussion. They filled Lin Xiaowan in on some important details.\nSince it would be rude for her to text on her phone while they spoke, Lin Xiaowan tried her best to remember everything they said.\n\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll inform Sister about it. How much does it cost?\u201d\nThe woman, who looked like a career woman, replied, \u201c17 children will be participating this time so it should cost about 3,000 yuan per person. If there\u2019s change, the money will be refunded; if it\u2019s not enough, then we\u2019ll have to make up for it.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan made an \u2018OK\u2019 gesture.\nAt this time, the waiter came in with the receipt. Clearly, the bill had been paid.\n\nLin Xiaowan asked, \u201cHow much was it? Let me pay you.\u201d\nUsually, when the mothers met, one person would pay for the bill first before the others paid their share.\nThe mother who paid the bill today did some calculations and said, \u201cI\u2019ve sent the bill to the group. You can transfer the money to me.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan took a look and found that it was 402 yuan per person. She felt like it was a little unfair. After all, she had eaten two slices of cake, a blueberry cheese tart, a plate of savory crab biscuits, and a glass of sparkling water infused with lime and orange. Everything definitely added up to more than 402 yuan.\nHowever, seeing that no one said anything, she did not say anything as well.\nAt the same time, she felt that the food here was really expensive. There was a pastry shop that she liked very much. A huge slice of chocolate roll in that place, which was bigger than her hand, only cost 59 yuan. A slice of taro milk cake only cost 55. Any one of the pastries there was much more worth it compared to this place.\nLin Xiaowan thought about the reviews she had seen. She thought about the atmosphere and environment here and thought that those who frequented this place likely only came here to take photos.\n\u2026\nWhen Lin Xiaowan went out, she discovered that it was snowing heavily. Although it could not compare to the snow when she was in the hospital, there was already a layer of snow on the ground.\nSomeone asked Lin Xiaowan, \u201cWhere are you heading? Do you want me to give you a ride?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan waved her hand and said, \u201cNo, thank you.\u201d\nAfter bidding farewell, Lin Xiaowan tightened her down jacket around her and pulled down her hat before she walked along the roadside. There were many cars here so the driver had parked slightly further away.\nAs soon as Lin Xiaowan opened the door, she was a man sitting upright in the backseat of the dimly lit car.\n\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d Lin Xiaowan asked, climbing into the car.\n\u201cI\u2019m here to pick you up. Why didn\u2019t you call the driver to pick you up at the door?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a few extra steps. Moreover, I\u2019m dressed warmly.\u201d\nHuo Zheng did not agree with her. He held her slightly cold hands before he handed her a hot water bottle. He was worried that she would catch a cold.\nWhen the car was about to drive past the place where she had afternoon tea, Lin Xiaowan caught a glance of a mother carrying a baby at the roadside. She quickly stopped the driver and explained to Huo Zheng, \u201cI saw one of the mothers I met this afternoon.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan watched as the mother carried the baby in one hand while she tried to hail a cab with the other.\nShe looked at Huo Zheng and said, \u201cIt seems like she\u2019s looking for a cab. Can we give her a ride? Her baby is only seven months old. It\u2019ll be bad if such a young child catches a cold.\u201d\n\u201cAlright.\u201d\nHuo Zheng was about to open the door and get out of the car when Lin Xiaowan grabbed his arm and stopped him. \u201cWhat are you doing? Stay. I\u2019ll go. You\u2019re a stranger. Don\u2019t you think she\u2019ll be suspicious if you tell her to get in the car?\u201d\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly. Thank you so much!\n\n", "39": "https://novellive.com/book/becoming-a-wealthy-familys-beloved-after-her-rebirth/chapter-39\n\nHuo Zheng helped Lin Xiaowan put on her hat and gave her another jacket before letting her out of the car.\n\u201cCome back quickly.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan had only taken two steps when she almost slipped. Frightened, she quickly slowed down her pace.\nHuo Zheng, who saw this from the car, frowned. He placed his hand on the car handle and began to tap on it restlessly.\nWhen the mother saw Lin Xiaowan, she was slightly surprised. \u201cWhat a coincidence. You haven\u2019t left either?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan pointed at the car with the blinking indicators and said, \u201cI saw you so I came to ask if you need me to send you back. The traffic here is really bad, and it\u2019s cold.\u201d\nThe mother looked\u00a0hesitant. She felt embarrassed to accept Lin Xiaowan\u2019s offer since they might not be going the same way, but at the same time, it was truly not easy to get a cab here. The cab-hailing app showed that there were more than 100 people waiting for cabs.\nLin Xiaowan said, \u201cLet\u2019s go. It\u2019s fine. It\u2019s inconvenient for you to stay here with your baby.\u201d\nThe mother was also tired from carrying her child and no longer refused. She said, \u201cThen I\u2019ll have to trouble you. I\u2019m really sorry.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, it\u2019s okay,\u201d Lin Xiaowan said as she led the mother to the car.\n\u201cBy the way, how should I address you?\u201d the mother asked, \u201cI don\u2019t even know your surname.\u201d\n\u201cMy surname is Lin. My name is Lin Xiaowan. What\u2019s your name?\u201d\n\u201cSong Mengjuan, but my friends call me Dujuan.\u201d\nThe driver was standing by the car. When he saw Lin Xiaowan return, he immediately opened the car door for her.\nLin Xiaowan entered the car and even helped Song Mengjuan carry her large bag.\n\nThis was the first time someone had opened the car door for Song Mengjuan, and she felt very flattered. After getting into the car, she discovered that there was a dignified and aloof man in the car. Just like that, she became nervous again.\nThe MVP was spacious with two rows of seats and a large empty area in the middle. Song Mengjuan sat unnaturally stiff with the child in her arms.\nThis was the first time someone had opened the car door for Song Mengjuan in her life. She was very flattered. After getting into the car, she realized that there was a man with a dignified and cold face in the car. She became nervous again.\nThe MPV was spacious with two rows of horizontal seats and a large empty space in the middle. She sat up unnaturally with her child in her arms.\nLin Xiaowan allowed Huo Zheng to remove her coat for her as she asked, \u201cWhere do you live?\u201d\n\u201cI live at Fengjing on Xinyang Road in the eastern district,\u201d Song Mengjuan replied. Then, she asked tentatively, \u201cIs it on the way? If not, it\u2019s good enough if you drop me off at a good spot.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan knew the road, but she did not know where it was. However, she nodded decisively and said, \u201cIt\u2019s on the way.\u201d\nAt this moment, Huo Zheng put away the coat and said with a straight face, \u201cDon\u2019t run next time. The road is slippery when it\u2019s snowing. Don\u2019t cry to me if you fall.\u201d\n\u201cI know.\u201d Lin Xiaowan knew he must have seen her when she almost fell. She leaned over and held his arm before she snuggled up to him.\nHuo Zheng did not say anything and only squeezed her hand. He really did not think Lin Xiaowan would watch her steps next time. He knew she would forget about his reminder. At most, she would remember for a day or two before repeating the same mistake again.\nAt this moment, Song Mengjuan\u2019s daughter was awake. She looked around and amused herself. She was very beautiful. She had a pair of big eyes, thick dark hair, and red lips. When she pouted slightly, her lips looked especially beautiful just like her mother\u2019s.\nLin Xiaowan leaned over to have a look at the child, and Huo Zheng held her waist, worried she would fall.\nThe two women talked about the child for a while before the topic turned to themselves.\nLin Xiaowan exclaimed in surprise, \u201cYou\u2019re only 26 years old? Wow, you got married so early!\u201d\nSong Mengjuan was very young, but her elder daughter was already in the second grade of primary school. This meant that she had her first child when she was about 19 years old.\nIn Shangxia, the legal age for marriage for both men and women was 18. Even then, very few people would get married and give birth at such a young age. After all, at 18, most people had just graduated from high school.\n\nHuo Cheng, for example, was 32 years old, and his two sons were in the second grade of primary school. He was considered young among the fathers of the children in the second grade.\nThe mothers who attended the afternoon tea took care of themselves very well, but quite a few of them were already almost 40 years old.\nWhen Lin Xiaowan mentioned the word \u2018marriage\u2019, Song Mengjuan\u2019s tense body seemed to relax as a sweet smile appeared on her face. She said, \u201cI fell in love with him so I wanted to marry him as soon as I could. He\u2019s really good to me.\u201d\nSeeing that Lin Xiaowan kept looking at her child and teasing her child, Song Mengjuan asked, \u201cDo you like children?\u201d\nThen, Song Mengjuan sighed and continued to say, \u201cIn fact, I didn\u2019t like children when I was in school. I thought they were too noisy and caused a lot of headaches. However, after I got pregnant and gave birth to my eldest daughter, I was just suddenly overcome with maternal love.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan listened attentively and said, \u201cChildren are really magical.\u201d Then, she added, looking troubled, \u201cSometimes I like them, sometimes I don\u2019t. I\u2019m also afraid of them crying non-stop, but they\u2019re really cute. Perhaps, I only like obedient children who don\u2019t cause trouble?\u201d\nSong Mengjuan stole a glance at the man sitting at the side. He was focused on watching Lin Xiaowan play with the child. His gaze was gentle, making her feel that the aloof man she had seen when she got into the car was just an illusion. It was not difficult to see that Lin Xiaowan and the man\u2019s relationship was very good. Hence, she said playfully, \u201cYou should give birth to a child and experience it for yourself.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan immediately waved her hands and said, \u201cNo, no, no. There\u2019s a big difference between playing with a child and raising a child.\u201d\nAfter giving birth to a baby, it was not like she could return it. She knew she was not ready to have children.\nIn fact, before meeting Huo Zheng, Lin Xiaowan did not think about getting married or having children. Her original life plan was to return to Beicheng after graduation and find a job there, living out the rest of her life there. She planned to save and buy a small house for herself. Then, when she retired, she would raise a kitten or puppy and spend her days gardening.\nUnexpectedly, she met Huo Zheng, got married young, and died young in her previous life. She did not want to get married young in this life and planned to date for a few more years.\nEarlier, Huo Zheng\u2019s expression was rather grim when the two women were talking about children. He only felt relieved when he heard Lin Xiaowan express that she was not ready to have children. He was determined to take good care of her health for the next two years. He would not let anything go wrong.\nDuring the journey, Song Mengjuan\u2019s phone suddenly rang. Her husband had just gotten off work and seeing that she was not home yet, he had called to check on her.\nWhen Song Mengjuan spoke to her husband, she changed completely. Her voice and words were both sweet; she spoke like a girl in love. When she ended the call, her mood was much better than before. She said, \u201cPlease drop me off at the intersection up ahead. My husband will pick me up.\u201d\nWhen the car stopped at the intersection, Song Mengjuan bundled up her daughter tightly and thanked Lin Xiaowan a few more times before getting out of the car.\nA silver car with both indicators on was parked in front of them. A slightly thin handsome man of medium height got out of the car immediately. He helped Song Mengjuan button her down jacket and adjusted her hat for her before he took the big bag she was carrying. The two chatted as they walked to the car.\nBefore getting into the car, Song Mengjuan turned around and waved at Lin Xiaowan.\nLin Xiaowan returned to sit next to Huo Zheng. She felt a little emotional after seeing the loving family of three so she said, \u201cIt seems like having a child is not a bad idea\u2026\u201d\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly. Thank you so much!\n\n", "40": "https://novellive.com/book/becoming-a-wealthy-familys-beloved-after-her-rebirth/chapter-40\n\nHuo Zheng\u2019s heart tightened upon hearing those words. However, before he could probe Lin Xiaowan\u2019s thoughts, she had already changed the topic. With that, he decided not to mention the matter for now.\n\u2026\nHuo Cheng and Qiao You\u2019an returned on the 14th day of the lunar new year. On the morning of the 15th, they packed up and brought their children away for a holiday.\nHuo Zheng had to work that day so Lin Xiaowan was home alone. She was working on the charm that she wanted to hang in Huo Zheng\u2019s car. She had not touched it since she was discharged from the hospital. She turned on the tutorial and concentrated on making the charm.\nAfter a while, Lin Xiaowan grew bored. Coincidentally, when it was almost noon, Gu Yuwu suddenly called her to ask what she was doing and enthusiastically invited her out.\n\u201cWhat do you want to do?\u201d Lin Xiaowan asked.\nIn fact, Gu Yuwu had an event to attend today. However, in her eyes, the event was very casual.\n\u201cThe Starlight Gala is tonight. Do you want to come with me?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan was not familiar with the Starlight Gala so she asked, \u201cHuh? What?\u201d\nGu Yuwu explained, \u201cIt\u2019s an event that\u2019ll be attended by many celebrities. There\u2019ll also be an award ceremony. Just treat it as a big party.\u201d\nApart from the lunar new year, Shangxia did not celebrate the Lantern Festival. In fact, Shangxia did not celebrate many festivals. The biggest event in the entertainment industry was the Starlight Gala, which was held during the Lantern Festival.\nPreviously, Lin Xiaowan had heard a lot of gossip about the entertainment industry from Gu Yuwu. However, when she received Gu Yuwu\u2019s invitation this time, she was not as resistant as before. Instead, she was a little curious. She asked, \u201cWhat do you do there?\u201d\nGu Yuwu thought about it for a moment before she replied, \u201cNothing much. The celebrities will walk the red carpet. After that, we can watch the performance and the award ceremony. That\u2019s all.\u201d\nThen, Gu Yuwu added, sounding a little proud, \u201cDo you want to walk the red carpet? If you want, I\u2019ll bring you with me. I still have a little status in the entertainment industry.\u201d\n\nLin Xiaowan exclaimed in shock, \u201cAre you a celebrity as well?!\u201d\nThe last time they met, Gu Yuwu did not mention this at all.\nGu Yuwu replied, sounding even more proud, \u201cNot exactly. I\u2019m a big boss behind the scenes. Many people\u2019s fates are in my hands!\u201d\nLin Xiaowan\u2019s mouth was agape as she listened to Gu Yuwu.\n\u2018How impressive!\u2019\n\u201cWhat do you think? Do you want to join me? Today\u2019s event is considered the most popular event in the industry. Almost half of the celebrities in the industry will be present,\u201d Gu Yuwu said before listing a few famous names.\nIn fact, Gu Yuwu had a small ulterior motive.\nShe had just received a script for a drama and was in the process of casting actors and actresses. There was a small role in the drama with a very short appearance in the drama, but the role\u2019s name was mentioned throughout the drama. It was the role of a goddess.\nThe goddess was described as having skin as smooth as cream and a pair of slender eyebrows and clear eyes. She was said to look young despite her age. She wore a loose pink robe with incantations embroidered with dazzling golden spiritual threads that tortured her day and night, making her look pale and frail.\nShe sat on the high throne of a god expressionlessly, looking calm and aloof, but her eyes were dark gems. They were pure and compassionate. When one looked into her eyes, they would make one\u2019s heart soften involuntarily. To put it bluntly, such a role needed someone unique. Someone who looked cold but possessed a pair of bright and expressive eyes.\nGu Yuwu had a few candidates in mind, but in the end, she thought none of them was suitable. One day, she suddenly thought of Lin Xiaowan.\nLin Xiaowan\u2019s eyes were not particularly big, but they were bright and pure. One sometimes felt as though they were staring into the eyes of a puppy when they stared into her eyes, making people feel like getting closer to her.\nWith this thought in mind, Gu Yuwu began to compare all the actresses she met to Lin Xiaowan. As a result, she grew even more dissatisfied with the actresses she met.\nThere was a young actress who became popular recently. Her appearance just met the requirements, but her eyes were wrong. Her eyes betrayed her cunning and shrewdness.\nThe character of the goddess was complex. If Gu Yuwu cast someone so scheming, no one would like the character. If the character was turned into a villain, the entire storyline would collapse.\n\nAfter that, Gu Yuwu kept thinking about Lin Xiaowan. She thought about Lin Xiaowan\u2019s expressions when they were in the hospital. She really regretted scaring Lin Xiaowan with the stories from the entertainment industry.\nGu Yuwu even called Qiao You\u2019an to test the water. Qiao You\u2019an did not seem to have any objection and told her to speak to Lin Xiaowan directly. If Lin Xiaowan agreed, the family would not object.\nFor this reason, Gu Yuwu finally called Lin Xiaowan.\nThe Starlight Gala was a good chance to observe the people in the entertainment industry up close. She hoped that she could show Lin Xiaowan that the industry was not as chaotic as it seemed. Moreover, she had also been trying to reform the industry for a while now. It was indeed much better than before.\n\u201cWon\u2019t it be too conspicuous if I follow you?\u201d Lin Xiaowan asked.\nIt\u2019s just like how Huo Zheng was at the center of attention wherever he went. He was too eye-catching. As a result, Lin Xiaowan would also be pulled into the limelight. This made her nervous and afraid to speak.\nGu Yuwu thought that Lin Xiaowan did not like the media so she said, \u201cWe vetted members of the press that are allowed into the venue. They\u2019ll only take photos of the celebrities, not us.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan was a little moved. The Starlight Gala did not sound very different from Huo Zheng\u2019s annual banquet. She had watched a lot of variety shows, a few movies, and dramas, and she liked a few shows that Gu Yuwu mentioned.\nSeeing the chance, Gu Yuwu said a few more words to persuade Lin Xiaowan. In the end, Lin Xiaowan agreed hesitantly.\nThe dress code for the gala was naturally different from that of the company\u2019s annual banquet.\nAfter Lin Xiaowan agreed, Gu Yuwu took the initiative to invite Lin Xiaowan to her house to pick a dress. She had entire floor dedicated to storing her clothes, which varied from casual wear to evening gowns.\nLin Xiaowan tilted her head slightly and said, \u201cI have clothes I can wear to the gala at home\u2026\u201d\nAlthough Lin Xiaowan had never attended such a formal and grand event, the Huo family worked with many designers. Although she did not wear them, many people would still send their custom designs to the house.\nGu Yuwu nodded. The Huo family was not short of money so this was not surprising.\n\u201cAlright. Are you at the Huo family\u2019s old residence? I\u2019ll pick you up. If not, I can give you my address, and you can pick me up. The red carpet will start at 5 PM. It\u2019s going to be about -4 to -5 degrees; it\u2019ll be freezing cold. We can go a little later so I can bring you in directly where it\u2019s warm.\u201d\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

Apart from the clothes that she wore daily that were stored in the bedroom on the second floor, the rest of her clothes were stored in the large walk-in wardrobe on the third floor. The clothes there were beautifully arranged like those in a clothing store.\nLin Xiaowan video-called Huo Zheng and told him that she was attending the gala with Gu Yuwu. She also told him that she was about to pick a gown and asked for his suggestion.\nHuo Zheng glanced at the weather forecast and said. \u201cThe temperature is going to be about 1 to -5 degrees Celcius later\u2026\u201d\n\u201cGu Yuwu said it\u2019d be very warm inside\u2026\u201d\nHuo Zheng frowned. \u2018How warm can it be?\u2019\nLin Xiaowan looked away when she saw that Huo Zheng did not seem too happy. Her eyes landed on a short and strappy dress that was decorated with white feathers hanging in the glass cabinet. She walked over and took the dress out before she asked, \u201cWhat about this one? It seems warm, right?\u201d\nThe chest area of the dress was decorated with feathers. The waistline was tightly gathered, and it was embellished with small diamonds to form a swan. The skirt of the dress was also decorated with white feathers.\nHuo Zheng did not think that the dress looked warm at all. It exposed her arms and shoulders, and the hemline did not even reach her knees. The feathers were only decorations and did not have any warming effect at all.\nLin Xiaowan could tell that Huo Zheng was unhappy with her choice so she returned the dress to its original place with a regretful expression on her face. She rather liked the dress, after all. She did not know where the feathers came from, but they were soft to the touch. Finally, she said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you choose one then?\u201d\nHuo Zheng was not satisfied with the dresses, but before he could think of an idea, his secretary brought a stack of documents in and informed him that the project manager was waiting for him in the meeting room.\nLin Xiaowan did not want to disturb him so she quickly told him to get back to his work. She promised to send him a picture of the dress she chose and assured him that she would not catch a cold before ending the call.\n\nAfter ending the call, Lin Xiaowan looked at the white feather dress again. She took it out again, planning to change into it to see how it looked.\nAfter changing into the dress, she looked into the mirror. The more she looked, the more she liked it. She tiptoed before nodding to herself, thinking that it would look even better with high heels. The high heels would make her legs look even longer.\nWhen Lin Xiaowan changed back into her original clothes, her phone suddenly rang. She thought Huo Zheng was done with his work so quickly, but she discovered it was Qiao You\u2019an when she answered the call.\nQiao You\u2019an had found out from Gu Yuwu that they would be going out tonight. She knew that Lin Xiaowan would need a dress so she called to see if Lin Xiaowan needed a stylist.\n\u201cXiaowan, have you already decided on what you\u2019re going to wear tonight?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan replied, \u201cI really like this dress with white feathers, but Huo Zheng didn\u2019t seem to like it very much. He said that it didn\u2019t look very warm.\u201d\nQiao You\u2019an thought about Lin Xiaowan\u2019s description of the dress for a moment before she asked, \u201cIs the dress from A Brand\u2019s Swan Collection?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan was completely clueless. She was not knowledgeable in this matter, and there was no tag on the dress. After a while, she replied, \u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d\nQiao You\u2019an tried to stifle her laughter but failed. At this moment, she and Huo Cheng were accompanying her children to a cooking class, and they were learning how to make glutinous rice balls. The teacher was in the midst of a demonstration, and she decided to hide in a corner earlier before switching the call to a video call.\nUpon seeing this, Lin Xiaowan turned her phone around and showed Qiao You\u2019an the feather dress.\nQiao You\u2019an recognized the dress with just a glance. It was indeed the dress from Brand A\u2019s Swan Collection. She said, \u201cThat\u2019s a good choice, Xiao Wan. if you wear this dress, you\u2019ll look beautiful just like a swan princess.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan smiled proudly when she heard these words.\nSeeing that Lin Xiaowan really liked the dress, Qiao You\u2019an did not dissuade Lin Xiaowan. Instead, she said, \u201cI should have a white shawl there that will look good with the dress. I usually wear it with a cheongsam in autumn or winter.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan listened to Qiao You\u2019an instructions and quickly looked for the shawl. She soon discovered that she had the same shawl in three colors: dark green, brownish-red, and silver-white.\n\n\u201cTry them all, and see which one looks the best.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan set her phone down as she looked at the shawls, unable to decide between the red and white one. She said, \u201cThe red and white ones look nice. However, is red a little too eye-catching?\u201d\n\u201cSo what if it\u2019s eye-catching? You\u2019re so beautiful, after all. When people see you, they\u2019ll definitely praise you,\u201d Qiao You\u2019an said before she suggested, \u201cHowever, I think you should wear the white one. The red looks a little mature, and it might age you.\u201d\n\u201cAlright!\u201d\nLin Xiaowan did not have any objections at all. She tried on the clothes and looked in the mirror, feeling very happy. Perhaps it was because she had never worn such clothes before.\n\u2018It really does look good,\u2019 Lin Xiaowan thought to herself happily. She was very satisfied with how she looked. Her skin was flawless, her waist was thin, and her legs were long. She could not help but praise herself inwardly.\nHowever, Qiao You\u2019an was not done. She quickly arranged for her makeup artist to go over. She would hire this makeup artist as well before attending formal events. As such, she was confident that the other party would be able to help Lin Xiaowan with her makeup and hair.\nBefore ending the call, Qiao You\u2019an said \u201cYou can use the big dressing room. Most of your things aren\u2019t here yet, and I have everything you\u2019ll need there.\u201d \u201cAlright,\u201d Lin Xiaowan replied with a nod.\n\u2022\u2022\nIt did not take long before the makeup artist arrived.\nWhen Lin Xiaowan was informed of the other party\u2019s arrival, she checked the time and discovered that only an hour had passed.\nThe butler asked Lin Xiaowan where she would like to meet the other party, and she quickly said, \u201cBring him to the big dressing room on the third floor.\u201d\nThe makeup artist usually did Qiao You\u2019an makeup and hair in his shop or Qiao You\u2019an\u2019s private residence in the city. He had only been to the Huo family\u2019s old residence once. This was his second visit, but he was still shocked by the size of the residence. From the time he entered the gates to the time he entered the house, it took ten minutes by car. The yard itself looked like a small park.\nAs the butler led the makeup artist to his destination, the makeup artist asked tentatively, \u201cMay I ask if my client today is the second Mrs. Huo?\u201d\nQiao You\u2019an did not reveal much over the phone so he was rather curious..\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

It was as though his master had married a second wife. After a moment, he said, \u201cYour client is the second madam.\u201d\nAlthough Lin Xiaowan had yet to marry into the family, the butler was confident that it was just a matter of time before it happened.\nThe makeup artist could not help but feel excited upon hearing these words. It was as though he had just heard a huge gossip.\nFor an aristocratic family like the Huo family, even if the media was not invited to the wedding, the family would generally release an announcement. There was no announcement so far, but it was clear that the Huo family acknowledged this new young madam.\nWith this thought in mind, the makeup artist could not wait to meet Lin Xiaowan, wondering what kind of woman she was. When he thought about how aloof, serious, and even a little fierce Huo Zheng looked in public, he could not help but wonder what kind of woman could steal the heart of such a person.\n\u2018Is she a sexy and mature woman? The Second Young Master of the Huo family is extraordinary, and his aura alone makes those who stand next to him pale in comparison. His wife must be just like him, right?\u2019\nFinally, the butler stopped in front of a door and said, \u201cI\u2019ll send two people up to assist you after this, Mr. Lu.\u201d\nThe makeup artist was pulled back to his senses and quickly said, \u201cThank you, and sorry for the trouble.\u201d\nIn fact, the makeup artist had an assistant. However, seeing that he had nothing to do today, he gave his assistant a break. He did not expect Qiao You\u2019an to call not long after his assistant left. Qiao You\u2019an was aware that he did not have his assistant with him today so she must have arranged this for him.\nThe makeup artist walked past two rows of display cabinets and turned a corner before he saw the person in the dressing room. He was briefly stunned as he thought to himself, \u2018Ah, she\u2019s not an aloof and sexy beauty\u2026 Standing next to Second Young Master Huo, they must look like Beauty and the Beast. No, no, no, what am I saying? Second Young Master Huo is so handsome. How is he like the Beast!\u2019\n\nWhile all these thoughts appeared in the makeup artist\u2019s mind, Lin Xiaowan stood up and waved at him as she said, \u201cHello.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan expected the makeup artist to be a young woman. Who knew it would be a handsome young man?\nAfter exchanging greetings, the duo began to chat. The makeup artist had a good personality and was very good at making small talk. He very quickly made Lin Xiaowan feel comfortable.\nWhen the two servants from the Huo family arrived, the makeup artist got to work as well. As he applied skincare for Lin Xiaowan, he asked, \u201cMiss Lin, do you have any idea about what kind of makeup you want today?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan was not very knowledgeable in this regard. Upon hearing the other party\u2019s words, she shook her head in confusion, indicating she did not have any idea.\n\u201cThen, can I have a look at what you\u2019re planning to wear tonight?\u201d the makeup artist asked. He wanted to make sure that the makeup would complement the dress.\nLin Xiaowan was currently dressed in two-piece pajamas with strawberry and bear prints, which looked very childish. She pointed at the feather dress and white shawl that were hanging on the rack and said, \u201cI\u2019m wearing that.\u201d\nAt this time, Lin Xiaowan remembered she had yet to pick out her shoes so she said, \u201cI have yet to choose my shoes. If you have time, can you help me take a look?\u201d\nThe makeup artist\u2019s style was very good. With just a look, Lin Xiaowan knew that he had a good sense of style and would be able to help her with her shoes.\nThe makeup artist naturally did not have any objections. In fact, when he had spoken to Qiao You\u2019an earlier, she had also asked him to help Lin Xiaowan choose her accessories. At the same time, he could not help but feel a little excited as well. The cost of the clothes, accessories, bags, and shoes here likely added up to eight digits.\nWhile the makeup artist applied powder on Lin Xiaowan\u2019s face, he said, filled with praise, \u201cMiss Lin, your skin is really good. I\u2019m not exaggerating at all. I\u2019ve done the makeup of female celebrities, but their skin really can\u2019t compare to yours.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan was embarrassed when she heard these words, but she also felt secretly happy. She said modestly, \u201cWhether their skin is good or not, they\u2019re all very beautiful. The entertainment industry is filled with many beautiful women.\u201d\nThe makeup artist said jokingly, \u201cThat\u2019s not always the case. Some are really beautiful, but some are fake\u2026\u201d\nTo put it more bluntly, some were natural beauty while some obtained their beauty through plastic surgery.\n\nLin Xiaowan only chuckled in response. She felt that if she continued on the topic, it would take a strange turn. As such, she did not say anything else.\nThe makeup artist applied natural makeup for Lin Xiaowan. One could hardly see the makeup on her face, but her eyes, nose, lips, and even her jawline looked even more exquisite. Although she did not look drop-dead gorgeous, she looked very pleasing to the eye. She looked like the sweet girl next door.\nLin Xiaowan was very pleased with the makeup. She still looked the same, but her features were more enhanced and eye-catching. Ever since she was discharged from the hospital, she felt that she looked pale and sickly, but now, she felt that she looked very energetic.\nThe makeup artist looked at Lin Xiaowan carefully and asked with a smile, \u201cWhat do you think? My skills are not bad, right?\u201d\nThe makeup artist was also very satisfied with his work. Lin Xiaowan had a very good foundation to begin with, and all he needed to do was enhance her features.\nLin Xiaowan nodded excitedly as her eyes shone with admiration. \u201cYes! I really like it! It looks great! You\u2019re really amazing!\u201d\nThe makeup artist truly felt like pinching Lin Xiaowan\u2019s cheeks at this moment. She looked extremely cute, and her cheeks were so soft. In fact, while he was applying makeup for her, he had to resist this urge as well.\n\u2018Huo Zheng is really lucky to have her. He\u2019s already so old, but he manages to find such a cute young woman\u2026\u2019 the makeup artist thought to himself. However, in the next moment, he apologized inwardly to Huo Zheng again.\nThe makeup artist knew that Huo Zheng and Huo Cheng were about seven or eight years apart. However, perhaps it was due to his domineering aura, most people assumed he was about the same age as his brother.\nNow that the makeup was done, it was time to do Lin Xiaowan\u2019s hair. However, she had to change into her dress first before she got her hair done.\nThe servant silently pushed the large clothing rack into the changing room to help Lin Xiaowan change, but it did not take long for a red-faced Lin Xiaowan to chase the servant out.\nThe servants of the Huo family were very meticulous. As soon as she entered the changing room, she reached out to help Lin Xiaowan remove her pajamas. Needless to say, Lin Xiaowan was not going to strip naked in front of a stranger.\nAfter she was chased out, the servant stifled her laughter and said, \u201cSecond Young Madam, please let me know if you need anything. I\u2019ll be waiting outside.\u201d\nWhen Lin Xiaowan finally came out after changing, she looked at the servant in embarrassment. Then, she hugged the shawl close to her chest before she went to look for the makeup artist. She could not help but feel excited after changing into the dress..\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

He finally understood why Qiao You\u2019an had called Lin Xiaowan \u2018the Swan Princess\u2019 earlier. The dress was very suitable for Lin Xiaowan. At the same time, he regretted applying natural makeup for Lin Xiaowan. He thought he should have made her look more haughty or cold. Nonetheless, she still looked very good like this.\n\u201cDid the shawl come with the dress?\u201d the makeup artist asked.\nLin Xiaowan shook her head and removed the shawl to show it to the makeup artist as she said, \u201cNo. It belongs to Sister You\u2019an. Doesn\u2019t it look good with the dress?\u201d\nThe makeup artist nodded. The combination of the shawl and dress looked better than he had expected. After a moment, he gestured to Lin Xiaowan to take a seat as he said, \u201cSit down. I\u2019m going to make a little change to your makeup.\u201d\nHe thought that no one would be able to stop him from making Lin Xiaowan look like a noble Swan Princess today.\nThe changes were very small and were limited to her eyes, eyebrows, and lips.\nAs Lin Xiaowan stared at herself in the mirror, the makeup artist, who felt even more satisfied, asked eagerly, \u201cWhat do you think? What do you think? Can you see the difference?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Lin Xiaowan said with a nod. She looked straight ahead before she added, \u201cI usually look at people like this\u2026\u201d\nThen, she raised her chin slightly before she continued, \u201cHowever, with this makeup, I should look at people like this\u2026\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s right! You look like a noble princess now so you should look a little more arrogant and aloof!\u201d\nLin Xiaowan chuckled. \u201cYou\u2019re really excited.\u201d\nThe makeup artist laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re just really very suitable for this kind of makeup. I\u2019m really amazed. Moreover, your temperament is good as well. Although your aura is a little weak, it\u2019s okay. I deliberately chose a lipstick that\u2019ll help with that.\u201d\nAfter that, the makeup artist began to work on Lin Xiaowan\u2019s hair.\n\nAlthough Lin Xiaowan\u2019s hair had grown longer, it was still difficult to tie it up high. Initially, the makeup artist wanted to tie her hair up into a bun. However, after realizing how difficult it was, he decided to curl her hair instead. After that, he helped her put on a few silver ornaments with pearls in the shapes of leaves of different sizes. After he was done, he said, looking slightly regretful, \u201cIt would be even better if you wore a tiara\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI think it already looks very good,\u201d Lin Xiaowan said, feeling extremely satisfied. She could not suppress the smile on her face at all.\nSubsequently, the makeup artist selected a pair of crystal carrings, a red agate necklace, and a pair of silver heels with tassels.\nLin Xiaowan really liked how everything turned out. She even got someone to take a few photos for her before sending them to Huo Zheng.\nThe makeup artist had taken a taxi here. As such, when Lin Xiaowan was going to look for Gu Yuwu, she gave him a ride as well.\nDuring the journey, the makeup artist found out that Lin Xiaowan was attending the celebrity gala tonight. He asked, \u201cMiss Lin, are you preparing to debut? I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be extremely popular if you decide to enter the entertainment industry!\u201d\nLin Xiaowan shook her head. \u201cNo, I\u2019m accompanying Gu Yuwu.\u201d\nThe makeup artist did not know Gu Yuwu, but he had heard of Gu Yuwu. He also knew how high her status was in the entertainment industry.\nWhen Lin Xiaowan picked Gu Yuwu up, the makeup artist had already left.\nGu Yuwu\u2019s eyes lit up as soon as she saw Lin Xiaowan. She exclaimed, \u201cWho are you? Why are you so beautiful?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan blushed upon hearing Gu Yuwu\u2019s words. She hurriedly said, \u201cYou\u2019re beautiful as well. However, you\u2019ve always looked beautiful anyway. You\u2019re just like a fairy who descended to the mortal world.\u201d\n\u201cLook at how sweet you are!\u201d\nGu Yuwu\u2019s figure was extremely good. She was currently dressed in a tight red dress that made her look very graceful. Her waist was small, and her hair was in loose waves. She wore a pair of black high heels. All in all, she looked extremely sexy.\nLin Xiaowan genuinely thought that Gu Yuwu looked great.\nWhen they arrived, the red carpet session was still ongoing.\nThe car drove directly to the entrance.\n\nAfter getting out of the car, Gu Yuwu held Lin Xiaowan\u2019s hand and led her up the long flight of stairs at the entrance. She squeezed Lin Xiaowan\u2019s hand and said, \u201cYour hand is so cute and meaty, I can\u2019t help squeezing it.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan smiled. Her hands were small and her fingers were short. Qiao You\u2019an had also previously commented that her hands were like that of a child. She had always been dissatisfied with her hands. When her gaze fell on the hand that was holding hers, she saw how slender and soft it was. She said a little enviously, \u201cI like your hands. My hands don\u2019t look good at all in photos.\u201d\nGu Yuwu said with a laugh, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll take a photo for you next time, and I guarantee that you\u2019ll like it!\u201d\nAfter entering the venue, Gu Yuwu bypassed the screen broadcasting the situation and led Lin Xiaowan to the side room before she handed Lin Xiaowan a cup of hot lemon tea. She said, \u201cTry it. There\u2019s no sugar so it might not taste good. If you don\u2019t like it, you can warm your hands with it first while I look for something else for you.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan held the cup with both hands and carefully took a sip. It was a little hot, but the taste was fine. The lemon was a little sour, but the fragrance of the tea leaves made it easy to drink. Finally, she said, \u201cIt\u2019s good.\u201d\nSubsequently, Gu Yuwu led Lin Xiaowan to the side and sat down before she said, \u201cAfter the red carpet session is over, we\u2019ll sit in the front row. You\u2019ll be able to see the stage clearly. The seats there aren\u2019t as comfortable as these ones so we\u2019ll go over later.\u201d\nAfter a moment, Gu Yuwu added, \u201cThere are snacks here. Do you want some?\u201d\nThe event would last for quite a while so the organizer had prepared some food. However, most celebrities had to maintain their figures and would eat as little as possible. As such, they barely touched the food. Even if they were hungry, they would still have to endure it.\nThe number of people gradually increased, but there were not many celebrities in the side room. Most of the people in the side room were assistants or staff members.\nMost people knew Gu Yuwu, and when they saw her, they would greet her politely.\nGu Yuwu responded to the greetings curtly as she handed Lin Xiaowan some butter cookies.\nMeanwhile, Lin Xiaowan, who was next to Gu Yuwu, watched silently. She felt that she had a new understanding of Gu Yuwu now.\n\u201cSo many people know you\u2026\u201d\nGu Yuwu said with a smile, \u201cI have a lot of resources in the entertainment industry after all. It\u2019s only normal for them to greet me for the sake of their artistes. In fact, I don\u2019t know them very well.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan understood Gu Yuwu\u2019s words. It was nothing more than networking. She turned her attention to the screen in the side room that broadcasted the situation outside. As she watched, she chatted with Gu Yuwu. When a male celebrity appeared, she told Gu Yuwu that she had watched all of his movies.\n\u201cYou like his movies? We can take a photo with him later. I\u2019ll bring you there.\nThere\u2019s no need to feel embarrassed..\u201d\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

Perhaps he was rather famous so his attitude toward Gu Yuwu was more casual. He was not like those people earlier who were clearly more flattering.\nGu Yuwu introduced Lin Xiaowan. Since she had worked with the male celebrity many times, she was also not reserved. She said, \u201cShe\u2019s a very good friend of mine. She\u2019s just like a sister to me. She likes your movies very much.\u201d The male celebrity had won the Best Actor award last year, and his popularity had risen since then. However, he did not put on any air. Although he was serious, he would smile as he spoke. Not only that, but seeing that Lin Xiaowan was a little embarrassed, he even took the initiative to stand next to her so they could take a photo together.\nLin Xiaowan could smell the faint fragrance when he stood next to her.\nAfter the photo was taken, the male celebrity asked, \u201cDo you want an autograph as well?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan looked down at her empty hands. She even left her phone in the car. In short, there was nothing for the other party to sign at all.\nUpon seeing this, the other party laughed and said, \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019ll sign a movie poster for you later and I\u2019ll pass it to Madam Gu.\u201d\nAfter a while, Gu Yuwu led Lin Xiaowan to the front row.\nThe moment Lin Xiaowan sat down, she understood why Gu Yuwu had said that the seats were not comfortable. They were hard.\nAfter settling down, Lin Xiaowan asked curiously, \u201cThat famous male celebrity from earlier is clearly much older than you. Why did he address you as \u2018Madam Gu\u2019?\u201d\n\u201cAge is not an indication of seniority in the entertainment industry. His form of address to me is a way to show respect and humility,\u201d Gu Yuwu explained.\n\u201cI feel like that makes you sound older,\u201d Lin Xiaowan said.\nGu Yuwu leaned over and said teasingly, \u201cThen how do you think they should address me so that I sound younger?\u201d\nApart from addressing Gu Yuwu by her name, Lin Xiaowan could not think of another answer to Gu Yuwu\u2019s question.\n\nGu Yuwu continued to say teasingly, \u201cNicknames can make one sound younger. If you think \u2018Madam Gu\u2019 makes me sound older, why don\u2019t you address me as Sister Yuwu? I\u2019ll sound younger that way.\u201d\nIn fact, Gu Yuwu had a younger half-sister. However, her younger half-sister was especially good at causing trouble and was quite evil. She liked to act pitiful and had a belly full of bad ideas. As such, Gu Yuwu could not help but feel disgusted whenever she saw her half-sister.\nOn the contrary, Gu Yuwu liked Lin Xiaowan very much. Lin Xiaowan was cute and innocent. She was very happy to be Lin Xiaowan\u2019s elder sister.\n\u201cSister Yuwu\u2026\u201d Lin Xiaowan called out tentatively, \u201cI\u2019m not used to calling you that way\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ll get used to it eventually. In any case, I told people that you\u2019re like my younger sister. It\u2019s only normal for you to call me \u2018Sister Yuwu\u2019,\u201d Gu Yuwu said.\nLin Xiaowan nodded, feeling that Gu Yuwu\u2019s words made sense.\nThe two continued to chat.\nAt the same time, the celebrities began to take their seats as well now that they were done walking the red carpet.\nThe members of the media also entered the hall, waiting for the event to begin.\nLin Xiaowan looked around. Since there was a show to watch, she wanted to eat something. However, when she looked around, she discovered that no one was eating. There were many beautiful women and handsome men, standing and sitting. It was truly a feast for the eye. However, no matter how good-looking they were, none of them was eating. Finally, she asked Gu Yuwu, \u201cCan I get something to eat here?\u201d\n\u201cSure. What do you want? I\u2019ll come with you,\u201d Gu Yuwu replied.\n\u201cBut no one\u2019s eating here. Will it be strange if I eat here?\u201d Lin Xiaowan asked as she looked at the familiar faces she commonly saw on the screen.\nGu Yuwu said with a smile, \u201cThere are members of the media here after all. Celebrities are very mindful of their image. It\u2019s only natural that they\u2019re not eating.\u201d\nAfter that, Gu Yuwu led Lin Xiaowan to the side room as she said, \u201cYou can do whatever you want. There\u2019s no need to care about other people. You don\u2019t know them, and they don\u2019t know you.\u201d\nAfter a brief moment, Gu Yuwu asked, \u201cDo you know why so many people came over to greet me, but they looked a little afraid of me?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan shook her head.\nGu Yuwu smiled brightly as she patted Lin Xiaowan\u2019s head and said, \u201cThat\u2019s because I\u2019m domineering enough. They know that they can\u2019t afford to provoke me so they don\u2019t dare to provoke me.\u201d\n\nLin Xiaowan was speechless.\n\u201cWhat kind of expression is that? What I mean is that you should be more domineering as well. You have the support of Second Young Master Huo after all. What are you afraid of?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan nodded before she said seriously, \u201cOkay. Then I want to eat that honey-glazed fried potato!\u201d\n\u201cHoney-glazed fried potato? What kind of flavor is that?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan was also afraid it would not taste good so she only picked up two sticks of potatoes to taste them first. After taking a bite, her eyes lit up, and she brought one to Gu Yuwu\u2019s lips as she said enthusiastically, \u201cIt\u2019s delicious! Try it!\u201d\nGu Yuwu\u2019s expression was a little skeptical and reluctant as she took a bite. Apart from honey, there was also the taste of cheese and cumin. Seeing that Lin Xiaowan liked it, her expression was a little strange as she said, \u201cYour taste is a little strange.\u201d\nAfter returning to their seats, Gu Yuwu left to bring Lin Xiaowan a cup of fresh jasmine tea, worried that the latter would be thirsty.\nWhen she returned to their seats, Gu Yuwu saw a female celebrity dressed in a plunging black dress sitting next to Lin Xiaowan. She was famous in the industry for her seductive figure and fox-like eyes. At this moment, she was staring at Lin Xiaowan with bright eyes.\nLin Xiaowan felt her hair standing on end when she sensed the other party\u2019s gaze.\nGu Yuwu was quite familiar with the female celebrity, and she knew that the latter\u2019s sexual orientation was not clear. She said teasingly, \u201cHey, hey, that\u2019s enough. This young woman is already taken. Stop looking at her like that.\u201d Meanwhile, Lin Xiaowan looked at Gu Yuwu as though she had seen her savior. Emboldened by Gu Yuwu\u2019s presence, she finally had the confidence to look at the person next to her.\nThe female celebrity smiled, thinking that Lin Xiaowan was really cute. She said, \u201cI was just curious. Is she a newcomer? Did she just debut? It doesn\u2019t look like it though\u2026\u201d\n\u201cNo, she\u2019s my sister.\u201d\nThe female celebrity was obviously stunned by Gu Yuwu\u2019s response. She looked back and forth between the duo before she said hesitantly, \u201cYour\u2026 sister?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan recalled Gu Yuwu\u2019s earlier words so she raised her chin slightly to look confident as she said, \u201cThat\u2019s right. Don\u2019t I look like my sister?\u201d\nGu Yuwu tried to hold back her laughter. She was thoroughly amused by how cute Lin Xiaowan was. Then, she turned to look at the female celebrity as well.\nThe female celebrity did not know whether to laugh or cry as she said, \u201cYes, yes, you do look alike\u2026\u201d\nNaturally, the two women did not look alike. Their eyes, noses, and lips were completely different, but since they had already spoken, what else could she do? She could only agree and nod..\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

She leaned over and said to Gu Yuwu, \u201cThere are so many awards\u2026\u201d\nLin Xiaowan knew that there were many awards in the entertainment industry. She had seen the news about it, which was always a hot topic, on her phone.\n\u201cThe awards given by different organizations have different values. Winning an award is also an affirmation of one\u2019s abilities. Apart from that, their status will also rise. They\u2019ll be able to attract sponsors.\u201d\n\u201cOh\u2026\u201d\nLin Xiaowan looked at the three young actors who were receiving awards whom she did not know. After a while, she asked curiously, \u201cWhat do you mean by sponsors?\u201d\nGu Yuwu explained patiently, \u201cSponsors are companies that choose celebrities to represent them and promote their brands. For example, Sang Xiyue is the spokesperson of the Swan Collection that you\u2019re wearing\u2026\u201d\nGu Yuwu rolled her eyes as she continued to say, \u201cHowever, I think there\u2019s something wrong with Sang Xiyue. Her brain seems a little underdeveloped.\u201d Lin Xiaowan knew Sang Xiyue. Sang Xiyue was of mixed race, and she was very beautiful. However, her acting left a lot to be desired. Lin Xiaowan had watched an idol drama that Sang Xiyue acted in, Although the reviews were very good, Lin Xiaowan did not really like it.\nCoincidentally, just after the duo spoke about Sang Xiyue, Sang Xiyue walked onto the stage when the Most Popular Actress award was given out.\n\nLin Xiaowan took a closer look and found that they seemed to be wearing the same dress. However, there were quite a few details that were different. She was not very sure so she asked Gu Yuwu about it.\nGu Yuwu replied without even the need to think about it, \u201cIt\u2019s the same. However, yours was custom-tailored so the details are different. Hers is likely the original. She\u2019s the spokesperson for the collection so it\u2019s only natural for her to wear one of the dresses from the collection.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan said, \u201cHer figure is really good. Our dresses are almost the same, but there\u2019s a huge difference between me and her.\u201d\nThat was the last conversation the two women had about Sang Xiyue during the award show. However, unexpectedly, after the end of the show when the duo was about to leave, Sang Xiyue came over and politely greeted Gu Yuwu.\nGu Yuwu did not have a good impression of Sang Xiyue so she only nodded perfunctorily. After that, she no longer paid attention to the latter. She whispered to Lin Xiaowan, telling Lin Xiaowan to wait for everyone to leave before leaving themselves.\nLin Xiaowan was not sure if there was any conflict between Gu Yuwu and Sang Xiyue. However, seeing Gu Yuwu\u2019s attitude and considering her relationship with Gu Yuwu, she naturally stood behind Gu Yuwu and looked around, not paying attention to Sang Xiyue.\nNonetheless, Sang Xiyue still maintained the smile on her face. When she was on stage, she had already noticed that Ling Xiaowan was wearing the same white dress as her. She took a step forward and stood next to Lin Xiaowan before she said, \u201cWhat a coincidence! We\u2019re wearing the same dress from the same collection. Do you want to take a photo to commemorate this?\u201d\nIn fact, Sang Xiyue was not in a very good mood. In her opinion, there was nothing positive about tonight except for the award she received earlier. However, even that award was overshadowed by a new female celebrity famous for being aloof. She had yet to leave, but many people had already begun to compare them, saying that she was inferior to the other party in terms of temperament and makeup. They even commented on her age, saying that she was already beginning to decline. With all these things, how could she not be furious?\nEarlier, Sang Xiyue had seen Lin Xiaowan, who was sitting next to Gu Yuwu. She did not recognize Lin Xiaowan; it was obvious that the latter was not famous and had no fans. Unexpectedly, the latter also wore the same dress as her. Initially, she was only a little unhappy, but when she saw the comments about her, an idea appeared in her mind.\nIn Sang Xiyue\u2019s opinion, Lin Xiaowan\u2019s height, figure, and appearance were inferior to hers. She felt that she looked much better than Lin Xiaowan. As such, she planned to approach Lin Xiaowan, hoping that the press would pick up the news of her wearing the same dress as Lin Xiaowan. This was not only a way to keep herself in the news, but also a way for her to vent her anger, which was caused by the new female celebrity.\nMeanwhile, Lin Xiaowan, who did not expect Sang Xiyue to approach her, was stunned. Then, she instinctively looked at Gu Yuwu.\nGu Yuwu stood protectively in front of Lin Xiaowan and said unhappily to Sang Xiyue, \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a need for that.\u201d\n\u201cIt seems like you have some misunderstanding about me. I just feel really happy that someone is wearing the same dress as me,\u201d Sang Xiyue said, reaching out to touch the feathers on Lin Xiaowan\u2019s skirt.\n\nLin Xiaowan was very resistant to being touched by strangers. However, she could not avoid Sang Xiyue in time. Fortunately, Sang Xiyue quickly withdrew her hand.\nSang Xiyue continued to say, seemingly sincere, \u201cThe fact that we\u2019re wearing the same dress means that we have the same taste. That\u2019s a good thing, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\nGu Yuwu crossed her arms and said with a sneer, \u201cIt seems like it\u2019s true that there\u2019s something wrong with your brain. Do we know you? You just approached us as though we were very close and even wanted to take a photo. Your thoughts are written all over your face!\u201d\nGu Yuwu continued to say, \u201cIf it\u2019s not clear, let me make it clear to you now that I don\u2019t like you. If you have any sense, you should get lost, understand? Let me tell you, Sang Xiyue, if you use this to stay in the news, it\u2019ll be over for you.\u201d\nGu Yuwu really hated celebrities with no talent who wanted to climb up using means like that. After she finished speaking, she held Lin Xiaowan\u2019s hand and walked away without another word.\nAs Lin Xiaowan walked, she deliberately raised her chin and straightened her back, ensuring that her aura matched that of Gu Yuwu.\nMeanwhile, Sang Xiyue did not seem upset that she was exposed. It did not matter that she failed to take a photo. After all, before approaching the two women, she had already made arrangements. The moment she had reached out to touch the feathers on Lin Xiaowan\u2019s skirt, the photos had already been taken.\nAlthough Sang Xiyue knew of Gu Yuwu\u2019s reputation, she was not afraid of Gu Yuwu. This was because she had never worked with Gu Yuwu before. What she knew of Gu Yuwu was from other people or the media. Moreover, she knew that everything in the entertainment industry was 30% true and 70% falsehood. As such, she was very certain that Gu Yuwu\u2019s reputation was exaggerated.\nWhen Sang Xiyue returned to her assistant, she told her assistant to sort out the photos that were taken. Then, she contacted a few members of the media she was familiar with to post the photos while they were hot.\n\u2022\u2022\nMeanwhile, Gu Yuwu was giving Lin Xiaowan advice.\n\u201cDid you see what I did earlier? I personally demonstrated it to you. When you meet unreasonable people like her, it\u2019s fine to speak to them the way I did earlier. Don\u2019t be afraid to fight back, understand?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan did not know if she could act the way Gu Yuwu did, but she still nodded seriously and said, \u201cYes, I understand.\u201d\nThen, Lin Xiaowan added, filled with praise, \u201cYou look so cool earlier!\u201d\nGu Yuwu did not even need to think before she spoke her mind.. It was indeed quite cool!\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

When the two women walked out, the car was already parked at the entrance.\nAt this moment, Lin Xiaowan, who was carefully walking down the stairs, seemed to have sensed something, and she looked up immediately. She saw a man standing by the car and looking at her from afar. Huo Zheng had come to pick her up.\nGu Yuwu saw Lin Xiaowan\u2019s eyes light up as she smiled and quickened her pace. Seeing the high heels that Lin Xiaowan was wearing, she was worried that Lin Xiaowan would fall. She hurriedly reached out and said, \u201cSlow down, slow down. What if you fall?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan rushed over to Huo Zheng, and he took a few steps forward, catching her in his arms. He patted her arm and asked, \u201cAren\u2019t you afraid of falling?\u201d\n\u201cI won\u2019t fall,\u201d Lin Xiaowan said confidently.\nGu Yuwu rolled her eyes as she thought to herself, \u2018Who was it that almost tripped earlier after only walking two steps?\u2019\nLin Xiaowan was really happy that Huo Zheng came and picked her up. It made her feel as though Huo Zheng missed her, and she had a sense of satisfaction from that.\nHuo Zheng continued to hold Lin Xiaowan in his arms while she chatted with Gu Yuwu. His attention was fully focused on her, ignoring everyone in the surroundings. A small smile could be seen on his face as he thought about his sister-in-law\u2019s suggestion to him during the lunar new year. Indeed, Lin Xiaowan should come out more often instead of staying home all the time.\nThe crowd at the venue gradually thinned and returned to its usual cold and silent state.\nSang Xiyue left very late. She noticed that after she asked her assistant to release the photos, her assistant had been a little absent-minded.\nWhen they entered the car, her assistant handed her a thermos. When she took a sip and found that the water was cold, she lost her temper. She forcefully pushed the thermos back to her assistant as she scolded, \u201cAre you an idiot? Did you not know the water is cold? You graduated from university, right? How is it that you can even get such a small thing right? What did the university teach a piece of trash like you?\u201d\n\nSang Xiyue\u2019s public image was that of an introvert. This was planned by her company and her manager to hide her quick temper. In private, if she was unhappy, she would lose her temper without care.\nSang Xiyue had three assistants, and the youngest one was the one she disliked most.\nThe assistant\u2019s face was pale as she apologized profusely, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry. I filled it up with hot water earlier. Perhaps, the thermos is broken. Next time, I\u2019ll make sure\u2026\u201d\nSang Xiyue did not give her assistant a chance to finish her words. She continued to scold, \u201cNext time? This time, the water is cold. Next time are you going to burn me to death?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not what I mean\u2026\u201d\n\u201cEnough, stop explaining yourself. I\u2019ll just treat it as a charity, raising a good-for-nothing like you,\u201d Sang Xiyue said impatiently as she looked for her phone. However, when she could not find her phone, she shouted again, \u201cWhat are you doing? Can\u2019t you see that I\u2019m looking for something? If you don\u2019t know what I\u2019m looking for, then ask me and bring it to me!\u201d\nAt this time, the assistant was cleaning up the water that spilled from the thermos when Sang Xiyue forcefully pushed it over earlier. Upon hearing Sang Xiyue\u2019s words, she timidly asked Sang Xiyue what she was looking for.\n\u201cMy phone! Isn\u2019t it obvious that I\u2019m looking for my phone?!\u201d\nThe assistant did not dare to say anything and handed the phone to Sang Xiyue. Usually, when Sang Xiyue attended events, her assistant would keep her phone for her\nSang Xiyue snatched the phone away and kicked off her high heels. She found a comfortable position and continued to scold her assistant, \u201cSo annoying. What\u2019s the use of hiring you? I really don\u2019t understand why Sister Lily hired you.\u201d\nLily was Sang Xiyue\u2019s manager. She was the one who discovered Sang Xiyue and signed Sang Xiyue. She was almost 50 years old. When Sang Xiyue faced her, Sang Xiyue would usually restrain her temper and treat her respectfully.\nThe timid assistant remained silent, feeling aggrieved. She watched as Sang Xiyue played with her phone as though she was chatting with someone. She could not help but feel a little afraid when she thought about what Sang Xiyue had ordered her to do earlier with the photos.\nWhen the car pulled to a stop at a traffic light, the assistant mustered up her courage and said, \u201cSister Xiyue, I want to resign.\u201d\nSang Xiyue would usually find fault with the assistant. However, when she heard these words, there was no reaction at all. She did not even look at her assistant as she said nonchalantly, \u201cIt\u2019s up to you if you want to resign. I don\u2019t lack assistants like you.\u201d\n\nThe assistant quietly brought her phone out and took a look. When Sang Xiyue was about to get off the car, she said, \u201cThen, I won\u2019t be coming to work tomorrow.\u201d\nSang Xiyue sized her assistant up as she said mockingly, \u201cIt\u2019s up to you. However, you signed a contract back then, right? If you leave so abruptly, it\u2019ll be considered a breach of contract. Your salary will be gone.\u201d\nThe assistant lowered her head and replied, \u201cYes.\u201d\nSang Xiyue could not be bothered to talk to her assistant anymore and quickly left.\nWhen Lin Xiaowan sent Gu Yuwu home, she waited until Gu Yuwu walked into the house before she left.\nHuo Zheng adjusted the white shawl for her as he asked, \u201cDid you have fun tonight?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan nodded and told him about the various celebrities she had seen that night, and Huo Zheng would occasionally respond with words like \u2018Hmm\u2019, \u2018Is that so?\u2019, and \u2018And then?\u2019. This greatly encouraged her to continue sharing her experience with him.\n\u2022\u2022\nAfter changing her clothes, Gu Yuwu was scrolling on her phone when she saw a headline. As expected, Sang Xiyue had used Lin Xiaowan to appear in the news.\n[The Beautiful Ambassador of Athena Versus the New Star! Who Wore It Better? The Answer Is Obvious!]\nThe article was not very long, and Gu Yuwu quickly skimmed through it. The article talked about the popularity of Athena and its Swan Collection, and the brand\u2019s status in the fashion industry. Then, it began to compare Sang Xiyue and Lin Xiaowan. The article also went into how Lin Xiaowan\u2019s legs were too short, her waist was too wide, and her features were mediocre before praising Sang Xiyue to the sky. The photos that accompanied the article also were cleverly cropped, removing Gu Yuwu.\nAfter a quick check, Gu Yuwu found a few more similar articles, and the photos were similarly cropped.\nGu Yuwu sneered as she thought to herself, \u2018The media think that they\u2019re smart and didn\u2019t dare to involve me in this matter. However, do they think that it\u2019ll be fine just because they didn\u2019t involve me?\u2019\nGu Yuwu did not have Huo Zheng\u2019s number so she called Lin Xiaowan and asked to speak to Huo Zheng.\nAt the same time, Lin Xiaowan, who had just arrived home, was puzzled by the call. However, she still handed the phone over to Huo Zheng and said, \u201cGu Yuwu wants to speak to you.\u201d\nHuo Zheng took the phone from her and said, \u201cPut on your slippers and change your clothes. I\u2019ve heated a glass of milk for you. Drink it after you change.\u201d \u201cAlright..\u201d\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

In the end, he told her that if Lin Xiaowan was still being ridiculed and belittled before he went to bed, he would intervene in this matter.\nGu Yuwu checked the time before she said, \u201cSecond Young Master Huo, don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re going to bed at 10. There\u2019s only an hour left before 10. How am I supposed to deal with everything within an hour?\u201d\n\u201cFigure it yourself,\u201d Huo Zheng said.\nGu Yuwu was speechless.\nAfter ending the call, Huo Zheng went on the Internet and looked at the articles that Gu Yuwu mentioned. There were many comments under the articles. After all, Sang Xiyue had just won an award tonight, and the brand of the dress was very famous.\nSoon enough, Huo Zheng saw a comment that accused Lin Xiaowan of wearing a counterfeit dress. The commenter presented various pieces of \u2018evidence\u2019 that supposedly proved Lin Xiaowan was wearing a knock-off dress from Athena\u2019s Swan Collection. The commenter even said that the two women were not wearing the same dress since one of them was a knock-off and that Lin Xiaowan had deliberately done this to gain fame.\nHuo Zheng\u2019s expression was very dark, and it took quite a lot of effort for him to suppress his anger.\nThe designer of the Swan Collection had worked with the Huo family many times. In fact, the designer had helped Lin Xiaowan to make custom alterations. In short, the dress was one-of-a-kind. However, that was now being used to prove that Lin Xiaowan was wearing a knock-off dress. It was ridiculous.\nAt this moment, Lin Xiaowan came downstairs in her furry slippers.\nHuo Zheng put his phone down and tried his best to act as though nothing was wrong. He decided to wait for her to sleep first before dealing with this matter.\nLin Xiaowan looked at her phone that was placed at the side. Seeing that Huo Zheng had ended the call with Gu Yuwu, she casually asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\nAs she spoke, she walked past Huo Zheng to look for her glass of milk.\nHuo Zheng subconsciously wanted to tell her that the call was about work, but he recalled Lin Xiaowan\u2019s previous words. They had promised that they would not hide things from each other. After hesitating for a moment, he said, \u201cShe was just talking to me about you.\u201d\n\nHe was not lying, but he was not very forthcoming either.\n\u201cOh,\u201d Lin Xiaowan replied nonchalantly. She was just about to ask why they were talking about her when she was distracted by the glass of milk the servant brought over. She asked, \u201cOh, is that strawberry milk?\u201d\n\u201cYes. Madam, have a taste and see if you like it. The chef made it himself,\u201d the servant said with a smile.\nAfter Lin Xiaowan was discharged from the hospital, the doctor recommended that she take calcium supplements. Apart from taking calcium tablets, she had also been drinking milk every day. She did not have any problems taking the calcium tablets, but after drinking milk for a few days, she had grown sick of it. She did not like the taste of it. As such, she requested for her milk to be flavored.\nLin Xiaowan took a sip and exclaimed, \u201cIt\u2019s delicious!\u201d\nSeeing how fast Lin Xiaowan was drinking the strawberry milk, the servant said, \u201cAlthough it\u2019s delicious, it\u2019s still best to drink the milk as it is. Why don\u2019t you drink the milk as it is and have flavored milk once every few days?\u201d \u201cWhy don\u2019t we do it the other way around? I\u2019ll have milk once every few days instead,\u201d Lin Xiaowan said, \u201cCan I have another glass of strawberry milk?\u201d\nThe servant naturally could not say much about this matter. She poured another glass for Lin Xiaowan.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to let Huo Zheng have a taste,\u201d Lin Xiaowan said before she left to look for Huo Zheng.\nHuo Zheng did not have a taste of the strawberry milk. When he saw the pink milk mustache above Lin Xiaowan\u2019s lips, he kissed her instead.\nLin Xiaowan\u2019s face turned red, and she complained softly, \u201cWhy are you like that? What if someone sees us?\u201d\nHuo Zheng led her upstairs as he said, \u201cSo what if someone sees us?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan glared at him and said, \u201cDon\u2019t forget that you\u2019re pursuing me!\u201d\n\u201cAlright, alright,\u201d Huo Zheng said with a hint of helplessness, \u201cMiss Lin, would you do me the honor of having dinner with me tomorrow?\u201d\n\u201cSeeing that you\u2019re so sincere, I\u2019ll accept your invitation, Mr. Huo,\u201d Lin Xiaowan said playfully.\n\u201cHmm, aren\u2019t you going to call me \u2018Brother\u2019?\u201d Huo Zheng asked teasingly.\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m going to call you Mr. Huo now,\u201d Lin Xiaowan said.\n\nHuo Zheng was helpless against her. He could only give in to her. After all, he liked her so much.\nMeanwhile, Gu Yuwu had also seen the post that accused Lin Xiaowan of wearing a knock-off dress. She was not angry at all. Instead, she laughed at the other party\u2019s ignorance. She was even more amused when the other party also used the white shawl as \u2018evidence\u2019.\nGu Yuwu continued to read the comments, and she was surprised to see a few people speaking up for Lin Xiaowan. There were also a few people who asked which agency Lin Xiaowan was from.\n[Are you sure it\u2019s a knock-off dress? Why do I feel like that newbie\u2019s dress is better than Sang Xiyue\u2019s dress? In any case, since the dress is from @Athena, I think it\u2019s best if they clarify this matter.]\n[If it\u2019s really a knock-off dress, can someone send me the link? The dress and the shawl look amazing! ]\n[The photos are so blurry, unlike other photos from tonight\u2019s event that are in high definition. How can you even see the details of the dress from the blurry photos?]\n[Oh, I think this new star is very pretty. Who is she?]\n[How can you like someone who wears a knock-off dress?]\n[Isn\u2019t it obvious that this woman is trying to gain fame from Xiyue\u2019s popularity? @ Athena, give us an explanation! Don\u2019t pretend to be deaf and mute!]\nMore and more people followed suit and tagged Athena\u2019s official account. After all, Sang Xiyue was the brand ambassador. It was not surprising that her fans asked for an explanation from the brand.\nGu Yuwu stroked her chin as an idea appeared in her mind. Then, she carefully wrote a few posts and posted them.\n[Let me make this clear. The Swan Princess in the photos isn\u2019t a celebrity. She\u2019s not in the entertainment industry. I was the one who invited her to the event tonight. Who knew that someone would shamelessly approach us? It seems like that person doesn\u2019t understand the human language and decided to make a scene.]\n[By the way, Sang Xiyue, who helped you to take those photos? You took such blurry photos of the Swan Princess, and you only photoshopped yourself. Why? Are you afraid of the Swan Princess stealing your limelight?]\n[Finally, the Swan Princess isn\u2019t wearing a knock-off dress.]\nThose in the entertainment industry knew that Gu Yuwu was very honest when she spoke. Coupled with her large fanbase, it did not take long before her posts caught everyone\u2019s attention.\nWith these posts, more and more people came to watch the show. At the same time, they all wondered about the identity of the Swan Princess..\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

She\u2019s fair and slender. The Swan Princess looks a little like Miss Ye!]\n[Are you serious? Ye Ye wore a black dress tonight. If you can\u2019t tell black from white, you should get your eyes checked!]\n[Hahaha! This comment is so funny that it made me laugh out loud!]\nGu Yuwu thought about it and was confident that Sang Xiyue would not have any other trick up her sleeve. Then, she made a call and arranged for someone to expose Sang Xiyue and clear Lin Xiaowan\u2019s name.\n\u2018I\u2019ve already told her that if she dares to cause trouble, I won\u2019t let her go. Why didn\u2019t she listen?\u2019\nAfter ending the call, Gu Yuwu checked her phone again and found that the designer of Athena\u2019s Swan Collection had spoken up about the matter, making this matter an even hotter topic.\nThe designer, Riccar, was not from Shangxia. When the head of Athena in Shangxia was informed about this matter, he had contacted Riccar immediately. There were very few people whom Riccar would make custom alterations for, and with just a look, he knew that the dress was personally altered by Riccar.\nRiccar, who was woken up by the call, was naturally unhappy that his sleep was disrupted. He grumbled, \u201cI make custom alterations for the Huo family\u2019s young madam all the time. Although I have a good relationship with the Huo family, I charged them a 2% craftsmanship fee for every piece.\u201d\n\u201cBy the way, who\u2019s the other woman? Is that the brand ambassador you chose? Hmm, it seems like she\u2019s wearing a counterfeit product. Huh? What recording? Whatever. Do what you want. You people from Shangxia are really troublesome.\u201d\n\u201cAlright, I\u2019m going back to sleep,\u201d Riccar finally said before ending the call.\nMeanwhile, the head of Athena in Shangxia was shocked by Riccar\u2019s words. \u2018What? The designer said that our ambassador was wearing a knockoff? And the other woman is actually the young madam of the Huo family? Since there are two young masters from the Huo family, which young madam is she?\u2019 He sighed. Initially, he thought it would be easy for the public relations department to solve this matter. However, it seemed like it would be much more troublesome than he had expected.\n\nHe resigned himself to his fate and got out of bed. He called the legal department of Athena in Shangxia and asked them to draft a termination contract as soon as possible.\nWhen the head of the legal department received the call, he thought that he was dreaming. Then, when he regained his senses, he called the public relations department.\n\u201cI\u2019m sending you the audio file. Listen to it, and release a statement.\u201d\n\u201cWhat statement?\u201d\nThe public relations department was also very confused. They had been monitoring this matter when they suddenly received this call.\n\u201cIt\u2019s about Sang Xiyue. You\u2019ll know what to do after listening to the audio file.\u201d\nMeanwhile, before sending the audio file, the head of Athena in Shangxia had an idea. He wanted to contact Huo Zheng, but he did not have Huo Zheng\u2019s number. As such, he could only contact Huo Zheng\u2019s special assistant.\nAssistant Song was already asleep at this time. Unless he was busy with work, he usually had very healthy sleeping habits. On most nights, he usually went to bed at 9 PM.\nWhen he was woken up by the call, he was still very groggy. However, after listening to the other party, his sleepiness instantly disappeared.\n\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d\nHe scrambled out of bed and checked the news.\n\u2018Help! Why didn\u2019t anyone inform me of such a huge matter? What are those people in the company doing? Don\u2019t we have people monitoring things like this 24/7? Well, I can\u2019t really blame them. After all, most people have never seen the Second Young Madam\u2026\u2019\nAssistant Song finally heaved a sigh of relief when he discovered that this matter only blew up about half an hour ago. There was still time for him to salvage the situation. In his opinion, his boss and his boss\u2019 wife were likely unaware of this matter.\nAlas, he was unaware that Gu Yuwu had already called Huo Zheng.\n\nThe other party called to ask Assistant Song if they should hide Lin Xiaowan\u2019s identity before he released a statement. After all, there had never been any news about Lin Xiaowan. It was obvious that Huo Zheng had been protecting her privacy.\n\u201cOf course. The young madam doesn\u2019t like to be talked about\u2026 If it\u2019s possible, don\u2019t post the photos with the young madam\u2019s face,\u201d Assistant Song said.\nThe head of Athena in Shangxia naturally understood Assistant Song\u2019s intention. After apologizing sincerely, he ended the call. He edited the audio file before he sent it to his subordinate.\nIt did not take long after that for Athena to release a statement.\n[We don\u2019t tolerate counterfeit products. We\u2019ve spoken to the designer of the Swan Collection and found out about a few unexpected things. First of all, we would like to apologize to the Swan Princess for this unnecessary trouble.] [@Sang Xiyue, please give us an explanation regarding your actions. You\u2019ve negatively impacted our brand, and this is considered a serious breach of contract.]\n[Our brand would also like to announce that we\u2019ll be terminating our contract with Miss Sang Xiyue.]\nFollowing these posts, an audio file was uploaded. It was the conversation between Riccar and the head of Athena in Shangxia. Since Riccar was speaking in his native tongue, translation was also provided.\nWhen Gu Yuwu saw these posts, she quickly called the person whom she had called earlier.\n\u201cDon\u2019t do anything for now. There\u2019s a huge development! Sang Xiyue is in huge trouble this time!\u201d\n\u201cI really don\u2019t understand what Sang Xiyue is doing. She\u2019s the spokesperson for the brand so she naturally has access to clothes from the brand. Why did she wear a knock-off?\u201d\n\u201cIn any case, delete the original photos first.\u201d\nAfter ending the call, Gu Yuwu quickly went on the Internet to watch the show.\nInitially, the comments under the posts made by Athena were filled with Sang Xiyue\u2019s hardcore fans. It was likely that they did not listen to the recording and rushed to defend her blindly.\nThese fans assumed that Sang Xiyue\u2019s actions that negatively impacted the brand had something to do with the comparison photos since they did not listen to the recording. They defended her enthusiastically and even felt that the brand had betrayed Sang Xiyue for an unknown person.\nHowever, as time passed, more and more people listened to the recording. Sang Xiyue\u2019s fans were at a loss. Moreover, Sang Xiyue had remained silent. With this, her fans gradually lost their confidence.\nAfter Lin Xiaowan fell asleep, Huo Zheng checked his phone. Compared to the last time he checked the news, there had been an earth-shattering change. Apart from that, the photos had also been deleted..\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

The termination of the contract with Sang Xiyue was also a hot topic. Even # SwanPrincess was trending.\nAlthough it was already late at night, many people were still commenting on this matter. It seems like everyone was a night owl who liked watching a show.\nHuo Zheng read Athena\u2019s statement before he clicked on the recording. He could not help but raise an eyebrow after listening to it.\n\u2018He charges us a 2% craftsmanship fee for the sake of our relationship?\u2019\nHe continued to browse the comments. Soon, he saw a comment left by a verified account. It belonged to a small but high-end clothing brand that specialized in traditional clothing. Qiao You\u2019an was a WIP customer of the company. The company came out and stated that the shawl was from them and even thanked Lin Xiaowan for the free publicity.\n[I just took a look at the official website! The price of the shawl is too much for me!]\n[My dream of buying the same shawl has been shattered. What a shame! I really liked the shawl. It looks warm and comfortable. Does anyone know where I can get something similar?]\n[To think that the shawl was used as \u2018evidence\u2019 to prove that the Swan Princess was wearing a knockoff\u2026]\n[I\u2019m really curious about the Swan Princess\u2019 identity. Gu Yuwu said she\u2019s not in the entertainment industry. So is she Gu Yuwu\u2019s friend?]\nAt this moment, an account that had just been created suddenly posted a photo. The photo was not extremely clear, but it was still much clearer than the photos that were originally released. At the very least, Lin Xiaowan\u2019s side profile could be clearly seen.\nThere were three people in the photo, and the angle from which the photo was taken was very good. Sang Xiyue wore a bright smile on her face while Gu Yuwu\u2019s expression was icy. Meanwhile, Lin Xiaowan\u2019s eyes were bright, but her expression was wary when she looked at Sang Xiyue.\n\nAssistant Song, who was Huo Zheng\u2019s right-hand man, had been keeping an eye on the situation. In fact, he was not the only one. He had spoken to the company, and there was now a team of people monitoring the situation.\nAs such, the photo that was uploaded was quickly deleted.\nIt did not take long for a few netizens who had seen the photo to discover that the photo was no longer available. Some of them left a comment asking about the photo. However, not many people had seen the photo so it did not generate much wave.\nMeanwhile, Sang Xiyue was in a terrible state. Her manager, Lily, had found out that she had tried to use Lin Xiaowan to become more popular and had scolded her badly.\nLily grew even angrier when she saw the accusation that Sang Xiyue had worn a knock-off dress and that Sang Xiyue\u2019s contract was going to be terminated.\nLily slammed her hand on the table and rebuked loudly, \u201cWhat should we do now?! Tell me! It\u2019s not like you just debuted so how could you be so muddle-headed? Are you stupid? You\u2019re the brand ambassador. Why would you wear a counterfeit dress? If you\u2019d asked for the dress from the brand, they would\u2019ve given it to you! What were you thinking?!\u201d\nSang Xiyue felt extremely aggrieved. She was wearing the clothes provided by the brand. She did not understand how it was fake. She protested loudly, \u201cI really didn\u2019t wear a knockoff! I don\u2019t know why the person in the recording said I\u2019m wearing a knockoff! Who knows if the recording is fake!\u201d\nLily looked at Sang Xiyue as though she was a fool and said, \u201cAre you stupid, Sang Xiyue? You were their brand ambassador! Why would they falsely accuse you? It would only negatively impact them! Can you use your brain before you speak and act?\u201d\nSang Xiyue was naturally upset. She was thoroughly humiliated this time. If she could not give a satisfactory explanation this time, no brand would dare to approach her for endorsement.\nLily sighed and said, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing we can do now. Apologize and admit your mistake. Keep a low profile for now.\u201d Then, her expression turned solemn as she continued to say, \u201cAlso, we have to find out why your dress became a fake. Who gave you the dress?\u201d\nIt was the assistant whom Sang Xiyue disliked most.\nSang Xiyue stammered a little as she told Lily that the assistant had made a mistake earlier so she had scolded the assistant. In the end, the assistant decided to resign.\nLily felt her temper rise again when she heard this. She scolded, \u201cCan you control your temper? She\u2019s your assistant, not your punching bag!\u201d\nAfter a moment, Lily felt that something was amiss. She frowned and asked, \u201cShe resigned so suddenly? She doesn\u2019t even care about her salary? You said that she was the one who gave you that dress? Didn\u2019t you feel that something was wrong at all?\u201d\n\nSang Xiyue\u2019s brain was the size of a walnut. How could she have thought of so much? In any case, she was usually a little harsh toward her assistant, and she did not think too much about it.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t right. Apologize first. I\u2019ll contact her,\u201d Lily said. She had rushed over here late at night and was now ready to leave.\nBefore leaving, Lily repeatedly reminded Sang Xiyue, \u201cRemember to apologize! Don\u2019t pay attention to what other people say, and don\u2019t provoke Gu Yuwu! If she really makes a move, it\u2019s over for you. We\u2019ll discuss what to do about the termination of the contract later. The most important thing now is to clean up your image.\u201d\nSang Xiyue replied irritably, \u201cI know.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan was blissfully unaware that Sang Xiyue had been exposed for wearing a counterfeit dress. It was as though the entire matter had nothing to do with her at all. She did not usually pay attention to news from the entertainment industry and would not deliberately search for it.\nLin Xiaowan happily dressed up and went on a date with Huo Zheng.\nAfter dinner, the two of them wandered the streets and ran into a street artist.\nLin Xiaowan was very interested and pulled Huo Zheng with her to get their portrait drawn.\nThe street artist looked like a college student. It was already close to the start of spring, but the weather was still very cold. Although his hands were red from the cold, it did not affect him at all as he drew and painted with watercolors. His movements were skilled and smooth.\nLin Xiaowan was not in a hurry to leave after the portrait was drawn. She stood at the side and watched the street artist draw with great interest.\nHuo Zheng did not rush her and stood by her side patiently. Seeing how interested she was, he asked, \u201cDo you like drawing?\u201d\n\u201cA little,\u201d Lin Xiaowan replied.\nLin Xiaowan had many art books at home. She also bought many art supplies such as brushes, watercolors, acrylic paints, oil painting sticks, and the likes. It was clear what her interest was.\nWhen Lin Xiaowan returned to the old residence, she felt that it was a little deserted. Huang Dabao and Huang Erbao started school today so they moved back to their house in the city. She also wanted to move back to their house in the city and expressed her thoughts to Huo Zheng.\nHuo Zheng did not reply, but he asked her if she wanted to learn how to draw instead.\n\u201cLearn how to draw?\u201d\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

You can learn whatever you like.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan had never thought about learning to draw. Although she liked it, she felt that it was impossible to make it part of her life. She was not hardworking by nature. She was satisfied with having food and a roof over her head. Her only goal in life was to live.\n\u201cWhy are you suddenly telling me this?\u201d Lin Xiaowan asked, confused. She thought that Huo Zheng thought she was too idle every day.\n\u201cI just thought you liked it. You don\u2019t have to do it if you don\u2019t want to. If you don\u2019t want to learn how to draw, what about singing or dancing? What about mathematics? I can teach you.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan did not like mathematics since she was young. She would have a headache when she encountered a mathematical question in the past. Moreover, the mathematics that Huo Zheng mentioned definitely was not the simple mathematics she knew. Who knew how difficult it would be?\nShe shook her head. \u201cNo, no, no, I definitely don\u2019t want to learn mathematics.\u201d\nAs for the others, she could consider them.\n\u201cI\u2019m not asking you to go back to school or anything. I just want you to have fun. I want you to go out more and make a few friends. I\u2019m worried that you\u2019ll feel lonely,\u201d Huo Zheng said, \u201cYou were very happy when you went out with Gu Yuwu, right? I hope that you\u2019ll be happy every day.\u201d\nUpon hearing these words, Lin Xiaowan realized that she had been overthinking things. She laughed and said, \u201cI thought you didn\u2019t like me being too idle every day.\u201d\nHuo Zheng patted her head and said, \u201cOf course not.\u201d\n\u201cWell, since we\u2019re on the topic, I don\u2019t mind learning how to draw. However, I don\u2019t have any foundation. I don\u2019t even know how to sketch. I don\u2019t know anything.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine. You can learn.\u201d\n\u201cWhat if the teacher is fierce? I want a gentle and patient teacher.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlright.\u201d\nThen, Lin Xiaowan suddenly changed the topic and asked, \u201cThen, can we move back to the city tomorrow?\u201d\n\u201cOkay.\u201d\nBefore going to bed, Huo Zheng meticulously massaged Lin Xiaowan\u2019s calf and feet. He had learned the technique from a few professionals to improve her blood circulation. Her feet were cold so she soaked them in warm water before going to bed as well.\nHuo Zheng\u2019s hands were smeared with medicinal oil, and the pressure he exerted with his huge and warm hands was neither too light nor too heavy.\nLin Xiaowan yawned and said, filled with praise, \u201cYou get extra points for this. The progress bar of your pursuit has moved forward a little. When the progress bar is full, I might allow you to propose to me.\u201d\nHuo Zheng chuckled and said, \u201cThen I\u2019ll have to work hard to fill up the progress bar.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019ll depend on your performance,\u201d Lin Xiaowan said.\nJust as she was about to fall asleep, Lin Xiaowan suddenly said, \u201cI don\u2019t necessarily have to learn how to draw now. Learning to play the guitar sounds cool too. In any case, I haven\u2019t decided yet so don\u2019t look for teachers yet.\u201d\nHuo Zheng placed her feet on the bed and covered them carefully with the blanket as he said, \u201cAlright, take your time.\u201d\nAfter the two of them moved back to the house that they previously lived in, Huo Zheng told Lin Xiaowan that he had hired a new nanny, who would come in the afternoon.\nBefore the nanny arrived, Gu Yuwu called.\n\u201cXiaowan, do you remember Sang Xiyue?\u201d Gu Yuwu asked excitedly.\nBased on Gu Yuwu\u2019s tone, Lin Xiaowan knew that something must have happened. She asked, \u201cYes, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d\nPreviously, Huo Zheng had told Gu Yuwu not to let Lin Xiaowan know that she was secretly photographed and used to increase Sang Xiyue\u2019s popularity. Apart from that, he also gave Assistant Song a bonus, commending Assistant Song for his swift actions. He also arranged for people to continue monitoring the situation, making sure that Lin Xiaowan would not be implicated in this matter.\nGu Yuwu was very sensible and did not mention this matter. She only laughed and said, \u201cDo you remember that Sang Xiyue wore the same dress as you? As it turns out, the dress is an imitation that her assistant\u2019s friend made. She was plotted against by her own people!\u201d\n\nLin Xiaowan was puzzled. \u201cIsn\u2019t she the brand ambassador? Why did her assistant do something like that?\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s no longer the brand ambassador for Athena. The brand has already announced the termination of their contract with her. She deserves it! Not only did she treat her assistant like a slave, but she was also verbally abusive to her assistant!\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s so serious? That sounds pretty sad. How\u2019s the assistant now?\u201d\n\u201cThe assistant has already resigned. Sang Xiyue apologized for this matter, but she didn\u2019t seem sincere at all. There were a few mistakes in her first apology statement, and she was mocked by netizens for it.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing that the assistant resigned. Although the assistant\u2019s actions weren\u2019t right, I can understand her. If I was treated like a slave and was scolded every day, I would\u2019ve done the same thing,\u201d Lin Xiaowan said.\n\u201cYou? Forget it. With your meek personality like a lamb, you can only bleat,\u201d Gu Yuwu said teasingly with a smile, \u201cIn any case, Sang Xiyue deserves it.\u201d\nThis was simply retribution. Sang Xiyue treated her assistant badly and insulted her assistant, which in turn caused her assistant to retaliate.\nAfter a moment, Gu Yuwu said, \u201cBy the way, there\u2019s something I need your help with. I hope you\u2019ll consider it.\u201d\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\n\u201cI have a script for a fantasy drama. There\u2019s a character that\u2019s very suitable for you.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean? Do you want me to act? I don\u2019t know how to act.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a few scenes. It\u2019s fine if you don\u2019t know how to act. Come and give it a try. This role is very simple,\u201d Gu Yuwu said, trying to persuade Lin Xiaowan.\nGu Yuwu knew that Lin Xiaowan was soft-hearted and did not have any thoughts of her own. As long as it was not something that she was particularly resistant to, Lin Xiaowan would likely agree. Moreover, she could tell that Lin Xiaowan did not hate the entertainment industry after bringing Lin Xiaowan to the event.\nGu Yuwu continued to say, \u201cThere are only a few lines for that character. If it\u2019s too difficult for you, we can get a voice actor to dub over you\u2026\u201d\nIf these words were heard by people from the entertainment industry, their jaws would have dropped to the ground. They would have doubted their ears and wondered if Gu Yuwu had been possessed. After all, she was known to pursue perfection, and it was a huge taboo for her when actors forget their lines.\nPreviously, there was a male celebrity who was praised to the sky by his fans. He was very confident about his skills, but he ended up forgetting his lines. He was scolded a few times, but he refused to make any effort. In the end, he was directly fired and thrown away by Gu Yuwu. It did not matter that he had a backer. Even his backer had to lower his head and be respectful when faced with Gu Yuwu.\nUnder normal circumstances, there was no celebrity who dared to forget their lines when participating in the projects that Gu Yuwu invested in..\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

Just like how painting and singing were fun, acting was also fun.\nHowever, after she impulsively agreed and calmed down, the more Lin Xiaowan thought about it, the more she doubted if she could do the job.\nAlthough Gu Yuwu said the job was very simple and that there were not many lines, she knew that facial expressions and one\u2019s gaze were very important in acting. Even some professionals who had taken acting classes were ridiculed for their bad acting. Then could someone like her, who had no experience at all, do it?\nAt the end of the day, what Lin Xiaowan lacked was confidence. She knew that a large part of it was due to her family and the environment she had grown up in. Although she tried her best to hide it, she could not get rid of her sense of inferiority.\nShe tried convincing herself not to care too much about other people\u2019s opinions of her, and she had been doing well in the past few years. However, she was still afraid of being around a lot of people. It was still okay she could blend into the crowd and stay unnoticed, but if she were the center of attention, her mind would go blank and her heart would race. All she could was smile stiffly. She was a little afraid of being stared at.\nIn her previous life, due to her request, there were no guests at her wedding. There were only her, Huo Zheng, and the officiant.\nThe more Lin Xiaowan thought about it, the more she felt that she had made the wrong decision. She should not have agreed to Gu Yuwu\u2019s request.\nLin Xiaowan sighed as her thoughts inexplicably drifted back to her marriage in her previous life. Once again, she felt that Huo Zheng was very good. He did not ask too many questions and would acquiesce to her requests. Thinking about it, she thought that she was a little unreasonable.\nWhen Huo Zheng got home from work, he saw Lin Xiaowan curled up in the corner of the couch, looking depressed.\n\nUpon seeing him, Lin Xiaowan threw the pillow in her arms away and said, \u201cI want a hug.\u201d\nHuo Zheng knew that something must have happened when he was away. He strode over and bent down to pick her up.\nLin Xiaowan hugged his neck and rested her head on his shoulder.\nHuo Zheng sat on the couch with her in his arms before he said gently, \u201cQingqing, you seem a little unhappy? Do you want to tell me what\u2019s wrong?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s nothing serious\u2026\u201d Lin Xiaowan mumbled before she told him about Gu Yuwu\u2019s request.\n\u201cAre you unhappy because of this matter? If you really don\u2019t want to do it, you can still refuse. It\u2019s not a big deal.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like that,\u201d Lin Xiaowan said, feeling conflicted, \u201cI\u2019m just afraid I won\u2019t be able to act well with everyone staring at me. At the same time, I want to be praised.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan was afraid of being the center of attention, but she also liked people praising her.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m good enough, but at the same time, it\u2019ll be a pity if I don\u2019t do it,\u201d Lin Xiaowan said softly and sighed, looking confused, \u201cI really don\u2019t know what I want either.\u201d\nIt was a rare and precious opportunity to be able to try new things.\nHuo Zheng chuckled and said gently, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. You should have a try. If you still feel that you\u2019re not good enough after trying, you can speak to Gu Yuwu. She\u2019s your friend after all. Friends should be understanding of each other, right? If you really feel like you don\u2019t know how to tell her, just tell me, and I\u2019ll talk to her.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan nodded and said in a low voice, \u201cI think I\u2019ll do it. They don\u2019t know me anyway. It doesn\u2019t matter even if I don\u2019t perform well.\u201d\nHuo Zheng thought about it for a moment before he said, \u201cLet\u2019s just take it one step at a time and set a small goal for yourself. You said that all you needed to do was sit there, right? Then let\u2019s just focus on that. Then, you\u2019ll deal with the rest as they come.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan sighed and said, \u201cAlright.\n\nHuo Zheng kissed her forehead and said, \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be amazing.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan looked at him with a grin and hugged him tightly as she said, \u201cI really like it when you praise me!\u201d\nIn fact, Lin Xiaowan\u2019s contradictory personality of wanting to be noticed and praised but also afraid of being noticed was partly due to her sense of inferiority. She needed a lot of love and adoration, and she needed constant encouragement from people around her. These were things she had always desired.\nHowever, she had never been loved or cared for, and she was also despised by her family since she was young. Not only that, but the people around her also liked to stare at her and gossip about her. As time went on, she grew more and more timid and also felt inferior. She always felt like people disliked her. That was why she was afraid of being around a lot of people.\nHuo Zheng looked at her smiling face and smiled as well. \u201cThen, I\u2019ll praise you every day in the future.\u201d\nThe Huo family raised their children by giving them a lot of encouragement. Huo Cheng and Huo Zheng grew up under constant encouragement and praise. This was also the case for Huo Dabao and Huo Erbao.\nFor example, when the two children came downstairs in the morning for breakfast, Huo Cheng and Huo Zheng would praise them for changing their clothes on their own.\nIn the past, Huo Zheng treated Lin Xiaowan like a normal person. She had always been sensible so he did not think that there was anything wrong with her. However, now that there was no longer any misunderstanding or estrangement between them, he realized that she was in fact very naive and lacked confidence.\nSeeing that Lin Xiaowan was now in a better mood, Huo Zheng changed the topic and asked her about the new nanny.\nLin Xiaowan quite liked the nanny who came over today and told Huo Zheng about it. Her surname was Wu, and she had a 14-year-old daughter at home. She was friendly and had a good personality. She used to work in the cafeteria of a kindergarten. All in all, she was gentle and efficient.\n\u201cAlright, as long as you like it.\u201d\nAfter that, Huo Zheng led Lin Xiaowan to the kitchen.\n\u201cWhat did the chef cook today?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan\u2019s unhappiness seemed to vanish as soon as food was mentioned.\n\u201cThere\u2019s yogurt salad shrimp. I secretly tried one earlier! It was delicious!\u201d\n\u201cIs that so? Then, I\u2019ll try it too\u2026\u201d Huo Zheng said as he brought her to the sink, \u201cWash your hands first..\u201d\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

She said, \u201cDoes it hurt? It\u2019s fine to stand on the floor. It\u2019s warm since there\u2019s heating.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Huo Zheng said, \u201cYou\u2019re very light anyway. You need to eat more.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan laughed. \u201d1 want to eat cake!\u201d\n\u201cAlright.\u201d\nThere were still a few roles that had yet to be cast in the fantasy drama. The production team was going to hold an audition so Gu Yuwu asked if Lin Xiaowan wanted to come and have a look. With this, Lin Xiaowan could also familiarize herself a little.\nAfter agreeing, Lin Xiaowan recalled that Huo Zheng said friends could show their vulnerabilities to each other so she said to Gu Yuwu, \u201cI don\u2019t have any experience in acting at all, and there are many people in the production team. I\u2019m a little nervous.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay. Don\u2019t feel too burdened. You just need to have fun,\u201d Gu Yuwu said reassuringly, \u201cMoreover, so what if you can\u2019t act well? There are many celebrities who can\u2019t act as well. If it really doesn\u2019t work, you can just quit. It\u2019s not a big deal. Don\u2019t be afraid.\u201d\nGu Yuwu spoke very nonchalantly as though this was really a trivial matter. For this reason, Lin Xiaowan felt much more at ease after listening to Gu Yuwu.\nThere were many people at the audition.\nLin Xiaowan followed Gu Yuwu into the audition room, and Gu Yuwu introduced her to a few people. Gu Yuwu told everyone that she was her sister and asked them to take care of her.\nLin Xiaowan stood quietly next to Gu Yuwu and smiled. She was still very nervous even though everyone looked at her kindly. Fortunately, the audition started very quickly, and everyone\u2019s attention was focused on the audition. With this, she was able to relax a little.\nThe main leads and important supporting roles had already been decided so the audition today was mostly for minor roles with a few scenes.\nLin Xiaowan did not know most people who came, and she only recognized a few of them, but she could not recall their names.\n\nAs she continued to watch the audition, Lin Xiaowan also deeply understood the difference in acting skills in the entertainment industry. There were people who could not act at all. When she watched an awkward performance that made people cringe, she even arrogantly felt that she could do better.\nNaturally, there were also those who acted very well. After their introductions, they seemed to change into another person as they got into character. Their acting was extremely convincing. Although there were many people in the room staring at them and whispering, they could ignore the distraction and focus on acting.\nLin Xiaowan really admired these people a lot.\n\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Gu Yuwu asked.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really interesting,\u201d Lin Xiaowan replied.\nAt this time, the audition was almost coming to an end so there were not many people left.\nGu Yuwu said, \u201cI\u2019ll get a copy of the script from the scriptwriter later. I\u2019ll show the goddess\u2019 scenes. When you go back, you can slowly go over them first.\u201d Lin Xiaowan\u2019s eyes lit up when she heard this. \u201cOkay!\u201d\nGu Yuwu cleared her throat and said, \u201cHowever, there\u2019s something I need to tell you in advance. There\u2019s a reason why I said it\u2019s fine even if you don\u2019t memorize your lines\u2026\u201d\nDespite the weak and young appearance of the goddess in the drama, her personality was aloof and arrogant. After all, she possessed supreme divine power. It was due to a curse that she had fallen to such a state and regressed to the appearance of a young girl.\nLin Xiaowan\u2019s voice was too soft and did not fit the character. For this reason, Gu Yuwu suggested dubbing.\nLin Xiaowan did not mind it at all. \u201cOkay!\u201d\nAfter the audition ended, the director walked over with the script and said, \u201cYoung goddess, you have to visit us often!\u201d\n\u201cEh? You know that I\u2019m playing the role of the goddess?\u201d\nThe director said with a smile, \u201cOf course. President Gu told us long ago that her younger sister will be playing the role of the goddess.\u201d\n\u201cThis\u2026 Does this mean that everyone here knows about it as well?\u201d\n\u201cAlmost everyone knows\u2026\u201d\n\nLin Xiaowan was stunned. When she had met the production team, she assumed that they did not know her. After a moment, she frowned in confusion and asked, \u201cPresident Gu? Who\u2019s that?\u201d\nGu Yuwu raised her hand and said, \u201cIt\u2019s me.\u201d\n\u201cWhy do they call you President Gu?\u201d\nGu Yuwu smiled and said, \u201cBecause I\u2019m an investor.\u201d\nNot only was Gu Yuwu an investor, but she was also the producer. She had the most say in the entire production team.\nUpon hearing this, Lin Xiaowan felt as though she had found herself an extremely powerful backer.\n\u2018How amazing!\u2019\nFollowing that, they studied the roles of the goddess.\nThe goddess appeared very early in the drama, but she only existed in other people\u2019s words and memories. She was extremely feudal, selfish, and had double standards. She would convince others to do things that were not right for the sake of the world and encouraged them to sacrifice themselves meaninglessly to help others.\nThe source of her curse, which caused her pain, was an immortal who had fallen into the abyss of the demon world because of her.\nThe immortal\u2019s lover was a very rabbit demon. The demon was captured by the goddess to ensure that the divine realm was not contaminated by the outside world. The demon was then sent to a place called the Twilight of Immortals to be cleansed of her demonic power for 4.9 days before she could be reunited with her lover. As a demon, one could imagine how painful the cleansing process was.\nApart from that, the goddess also imprisoned the immortal in a divine realm for violating the divine rule. He was soaked in a liquid that corroded his divine power every day, and it was extremely difficult to leave this place. When he finally escaped, he risked his life to save his lover. Alas, when he found his lover, she had been tortured to the brink of death. When she saw him, before her soul scattered, she only said, \u201cI hate you.\u201d\nFollowing that, the immortal sacrificed his divine power to place a curse on the goddess before he fell to the demon world with great hatred.\nMeanwhile, the goddess did not think that she did anything wrong at all. She felt that her actions were for the couple\u2019s own good. When she saw that the immortal had turned demonic, she only said disdainfully, \u201cFool.\u201d\nThe only time the goddess appeared outside of people\u2019s words and memories in the drama was close to the finale. The protagonists had something to ask of her so they went to meet her. The goddess could perceive everything in the world and knew their intentions so she said some arrogant words to dissuade them.\nThe protagonists were strong and tenacious, after all. How could they be persuaded by her? It was only normal that they completely ignored her..\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

In any case, after a one-on-one conversation with the son of heaven whom she thought the most highly of, she sighed and ended up helping him to resolve the predicament before disappearing.\nLin Xiaowan had to admit that she did not quite understand everything. However, she could tell the character of the goddess was stubborn and feudal. Although she was a goddess above everyone, she was also a little ignorant and bad.\nLin Xiaowan thought about it for a long time before she said, \u201cThis goddess seems to hate seeing others live well\u2026:\nThe goddess\u2019 scenes mostly had to do with the source of the curse, but there were quite a few scenes that depicted the way she did things. As Lin Xiaowan said, many of her actions were targeted at people who lived blissfully.\nThe director, who liked the character of the goddess who was not too involved in the main storyline but was mostly in the side story, said, \u201cTo put it bluntly, she\u2019s a little twisted. The more she wants something, the more she can\u2019t get it. Not only that, but what she can\u2019t get, she finds that others can easily get them.\u201d \u201cWhat is it that she wants?\u201d Lin Xiaowan asked.\nThe director replied, \u201cThat\u2019s a good question. You\u2019re the goddess. What do you want?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan thought that the goddess was jealous. She was jealous that others could love and be loved while she was alone. She sat on a high throne and looked down on all living beings without anyone to talk to. Others were afraid of her, respected her, or disliked her, but none of them was willing to stand next to her.\n\n\u201cHow did she become a goddess?\u201d Lin Xiaowan asked curiously.\nThe director said with a hint of pity, \u201cShe was sacrificed by her family after she was chosen by the heavens. In fact, although her appearance in the drama isn\u2019t a lot, she\u2019s mentioned many times by others.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan was very interested in the character. After she returned from the audition, she began to read the thick script from the beginning. She went to bed very late because she was reading the script.\nHuo Zheng urged her a few times to go to bed, but she did not listen. She was very close to the finale and there were only a few pages left after all. Hence, she quickly leaned closer to him and coaxed him softly. It was really not easy for her to get Huo Zheng to agree to let her sleep a little later.\nIn the end, after she finished reading the script, she found that she could not sleep. She was sad and upset because of the bad ending. Some of the main characters were separated, and none of them had a perfect happy ending!\nLin Xiaowan threw herself into Huo Zheng\u2019s arms and began to cry loudly as she scolded the scriptwriter.\nThe drama was actually quite old-fashioned. There were nine young people with different personalities who became friends by accident. All of them had different identities from a wealthy young master to a little beggar. They killed demons together and grew closer and closer; some of them even fell in love. After that, due to an accident in the divine realm, the goddess came and convinced a few people to sacrifice some people to fix the accident. Subsequently, many bad things happen in the divine realm and the demon realm one after another. The protagonists naturally hated the goddess\u2019 style of doing things. Because the realms were in turmoil, they worked together to save the world. They also woke up those who were brainwashed by the goddess.\nThe protagonists continued doing this until one day, a new demon king appeared in the demon realm. He wanted to destroy the world, and it was actually because of the goddess. The more they learned about the goddess, the more they hated her. However, as though the goddess was mocking them, she no longer appeared. On one hand, they wanted to persuade the demon king to surrender and stabilize the realms, but at the same time, they wanted to overthrow the goddess\u2019 commander. It was a difficult task to take down the goddess. After all, she had lived for a long time, and there were too many people who brainlessly believed and supported her.\nWhat followed was a long journey to protect the realms and take down the goddess. The protagonists\u2019 relationships continued to improve. There was love and friendship between them, becoming like a family. However, the goddess began to target them at this time. They resisted the goddess, and grew stronger in the process. In the end, they managed to obtain a divine spark and go to the divine realm. It was there that they met the goddess in person and ended the goddess\u2019 tyranny.\nHowever, that was not the end. After that, they realized that the turmoil was not over yet. They had experienced wars and tragic sacrifices, and in the end, only a few survived. After that, they realized that they could not live carefree lives. There were countless small worlds under the divine realm that needed governing and protection from powerful people. They were no longer as carefree as when they were young and could do as they pleased. They were now immortals with responsibilities.\n\nIt was also then that these new immortals discovered that there were no new people in the divine realm for tens of thousands of years. There was only the goddess looking down on everything, but she had already disappeared.\nThe final outcome was that the remaining four people guarded their respective worlds. Due to their immortality, they lived forever in loneliness.\nLin Xiaowan found the ending hard to accept. She complained, \u201cWhy can\u2019t they just stay together in the divine realm and find people with the potential to become immortals? Why do they have to separate? Why can\u2019t they be together?\u201d\nHuo Zheng did not know what to say to comfort her so he only hugged her and stroked her back silently.\nIn the end, Lin Xiaowan, who felt extremely uncomfortable, fell asleep.\nWhen the first day of filming started, Lin Xiaowan followed Gu Yuwu and the production team enthusiastically. Her scenes had not been arranged yet so all she had to do was follow Gu Yuwu for now.\nLin Xiaowan, who was with the production team, thought to herself excitedly, \u201cLet me have a look! Let me have a look! Where are the protagonists?\u2019\nOn the first day of filming, the first of the leading actors Lin Xiaowan saw was a young actor who was a child star. Lin Xiaowan had seen his movies and dramas before so she was rather familiar with him. He was dressed in a blue robe, and he played the character of a wealthy young master among the nine people. He was one of the last people who died tragically in the end.\nFollowing that, the leading actors arrived in an orderly manner. Everyone took a photo for the opening of the film. There were so many people that they had to stand in four or five rows.\nLin Xiaowan did not seem uncomfortable surrounded by so many people this time when she took the photo. There were so many people in the photo that it would be difficult to pick her out from the crowd.\nAfter that, she sent Huo Zheng the photo along with a message.\n[Can you find me in the crowd?]\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

However, she soon discovered that Huo Zheng was serious about looking for her in the photo. When she received his reply, half a day had already passed. She wondered how long he took to find her.\nLin Xiaowan praised him seriously before telling him to work hard and not slack off.\n[Huo Zheng: It\u2019s time for me to get off work. What time will you be back?]\nIt was especially busy on set, and it was normal to film night scenes. She was now in a filming studio on the outskirts of Shengjing, and it was a long journey back home. She had followed Gu Yuwu here today and forgot to ask about the schedule today.\nGu Yuwu spent most of her time with the director. Lin Xiaowan could not understand the professional jargon they used and grew bored after a while. In the end, she stayed with the other staff members.\n[Lin Xiaowan: I came with Gu Yuwu today. I don\u2019t know when we\u2019re leaving. I\u2019ll ask later.]\n[Huo Zheng: Get the driver to pick you up.]\nLin Xiaowan felt reluctant since the location was quite a distance away. After a while, she jogged over to Gu Yuwu.\nWhen Gu Yuwu saw Lin Xiaowan, she felt a little helpless. She smoothed Lin Xiaowan\u2019s messy hair and asked teasingly, \u201cOh, you still remember to look for me?\u201d\nIn the beginning, Lin Xiaowan had stayed close to Gu Yuwu. However, after filming started, she did not know where Lin Xiaowan went. She thought that Lin Xiaowan had lost her way, and after asking around for a long time, she found out that Lin Xiaowan was wandering around and having fun.\nGu Yuwu said, \u201cIn the future, when you\u2019re leaving, you have to tell the people around you in advance, do you understand?\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Lin Xiaowan replied with a nod before she asked, \u201cAre you going back later or will you be staying here?\u201d\nThe production team had booked three floors of a nearby hotel for the actors and production team.\n\nGu Yuwu thought that Lin Xiaowan wanted to leave. She looked at the time and thought that Lin Xiaowan was not needed later so she said, \u201cYou want to leave? I\u2019ll bring you back later.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan hurriedly said, \u201cThere\u2019s no need for that. If you\u2019re busy with work, I can ask the driver to pick me up.\u201d\nGu Yuwu chuckled. \u2018Tin not too busy. We\u2019ll be filming in the studio for a period of time. The actors have already planned how much they\u2019ll shoot in a day. The earlier we finish filming, the earlier well be done.\u201d\nToday was the first day of filming, and the few scenes they were shooting today involved actors who were remarkably skilled.\nIn the end, Lin Xiaowan told Huo Zheng that there was no need to send the driver.\n\u25a0 \u2022\nGu Yuwu was in a good mood today. Most of the actors were old friends whom she had worked with before, and they were all very skilled. With very simple adjustments and little communication, they could easily film a scene without many takes.\nWhen they were leaving, Lin Xiaowan asked, \u201cHow long will we be filming in the studio?\u201d\nGu Yuwu opened the car door and urged Lin Xiaowan to get in before she replied, \u201cFor a while. We\u2019re shooting part of the interior scenes in the studio. Did you see the green screen earlier? It\u2019s for the convenience of post-production. At the end of March or the beginning of April, we\u2019ll move to Yingshui in Nan\u2019an Province to shoot outside.\u201d\nGu Yuwu continued to say, \u201cThe scenes of the goddess will be shot in the studio. However, it\u2019s fine if you want to go to Yingshui to have a look. I\u2019ve been there before for an inspection, and the scenery is very good.\u201d\n\u201cOkay.\u201d\n\u201cHow did you feel on set today?\u201d Gu Yuwu asked.\n\u201cVery good! The staff members even praised me for being beautiful! They said that if I start acting, I\u2019ll be a big star,\u201d Lin Xiaowan said, happy that she was praised, \u201cI was very impressed as well when I watched the actors. There was so much equipment and people around, but they weren\u2019t affected at all. Their movements and speech weren\u2019t stiff. They were really amazing!\u201d\nLin Xiaowan had been seriously observing and learning. Although it was only a day, she learned that being afraid of this and that would not produce any results at all.\nGu Yuwu smiled. \u201cThe people today are professionals. You haven\u2019t seen a lot so you don\u2019t know that people like them are rare. There are also people who have so many bad takes that filming could go on for a long time. In any case, if you\u2019re interested, you can come more often to watch.\u201d\nIt would be Valentine\u2019s Day soon. Seeing that Lin Xiaowan had been going to the set every day, Huo Zheng asked her one night, \u201cWill you be going to the set tomorrow as well?\u201d\n\nLin Xiaowan was applying skincare and did not think much of his question. She replied, \u201cYes. It\u2019s quite fun to watch the filming. Perhaps I\u2019ve been going so often, I\u2019m no longer as nervous when surrounded by a lot of people.\u201d\nSeeing that she already had plans, Huo Zheng hesitated for a moment. In the end, he did not say anything.\nThe next morning, Lin Xiaowan found a large bouquet of champagne roses and a large bottle of perfume on her dressing table. The perfume was a Valentine\u2019s Day limited edition perfume.\nOnly when she saw these things did realization dawn on Lin Xiaowan. She checked the calendar and confirmed that it was Valentine\u2019s Day.\nInitially, she planned to do something with Huo Zheng on Valentine\u2019s Day. However, after the Lantern Festival and filming started, she completely forgot about this.\n\u2018No wonder Huo Zheng was asking about my plan yesterday\u2026\u2019\nLin Xiaowan felt a little embarrassed. She had forgotten, but he had remembered. He clearly wanted to spend time with her, but he did not say anything. Since he had left for the office, she quickly called him.\nThe call connected swiftly, and they were both silent for a moment.\nIn the end, Huo Zheng called out, sounding puzzled, \u201cQingqing?\u201d\n\u201cWhat day is it today?\u201d Lin Xiaowan asked despite already knowing the answer.\nHuo Zheng paused for a moment. \u201cValentine\u2019s Day?\u201d\n\u201cSince you knew, why didn\u2019t you say anything last night? I forgot, but you could\u2019ve reminded me,\u201d Lin Xiaowan said.\n\u201cYou have plans, after all. I don\u2019t want to mess up your plan.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan rolled her eyes. \u201cWhat are you saying? I\u2019m going to get angry.\u201d\nHuo Zheng remained silent, not sure what he had said wrong. After thinking about it for a moment, he apologized. He had forgotten where he had read it, but it was said that if one\u2019s girlfriend was angry, one should apologize first.\n\u201cPlease, I didn\u2019t call to hear your apology, Brother,\u201d Lin Xiaowan said, feeling slightly speechless. An idea suddenly appeared in her mind, and she pretended to say cutely, \u201cBrother, why are you apologizing? Do you not want to spend Valentine\u2019s with me? I understand. You don\u2019t love me anymore. It\u2019s okay. I\u2019ll feel better after crying for three hours.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like that,\u201d Huo Zheng said. Although there was no one in the office, he still lowered his voice as he continued to say in a hoarse voice, \u201cSpeak properly.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan instantly returned to normal as she said teasingly, \u201cHuh? You seemed to like it though.. Don\u2019t tell me you like this?\u201d\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

It\u2019s Valentine\u2019s Day today, and I miss you so much. Don\u2019t you miss me?\u201d\nHuo Zheng took a deep breath before he ended the call.\nHuo Zheng had never hung up on Lin Xiaowan before, whether it was this life or her previous life. This was a first.\nLin Xiaowan could not help but laugh. She quickly called Gu Yuwu and told Gu Yuwu that she would not be going to the set today.\nGu Yuwu was not surprised at all. \u201cI was wondering about this before when you told me that you were going to the set on Valentine\u2019s Day. As it turns out, you forgot.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan remembered that Gu Yuwu was a married person so she asked curiously, \u201cWhat about you? Are you going to the set on Valentine\u2019s Day?\u201d\nGu Yuwu glanced at the dog in human form staring at her before she said in a helpless tone, \u201cYes, but my husband followed me to the set. I\u2019ll be leaving early.\u201d\nWhen Lin Xiaowan finally ended the call, she saw that she had missed a call from Huo Zheng. He probably called back after seeing there was no reaction from her after he hung up on her. Apart from a missed call, there was also a message from him.\n[Huo Zheng: Who are you talking to? Are you going out today?]\n[Lin Xiaowan: I want to watch a movie with you. Don\u2019t rent out the entire theatre. Let\u2019s buy couple seats and watch it with a group of people\u2026]\nLin Xiaowan rarely watched movies with Huo Zheng. She had only watched movies with him a few times, and she discovered that he was not very interested in watching movies. Whether it was a horror movie, a romantic movie, or a comedic movie, he did not have much of a reaction. His expression remained serious throughout the movie as though he was watching some serious documentary. Not only that, but they mostly watched movies in private theatres or in their home theatre. The atmosphere was different from watching it in a cinema. Apart from that, it was tragically funny when she tried to discuss the plot with him. For all these reasons, she rarely asked him to watch a movie with her.\n\nAfter thinking about it for a moment, Lin Xiaowan sent another message.\n[Lin Xiaowan: I\u2019ll buy the tickets. You\u2019re unreliable, and I don\u2019t trust you to do it.]\nThis was the first time Huo Zheng was called unreliable. He did not know whether to laugh or cry as he agreed to her request. After that, he called his assistant and secretary and told them to put the documents away, which were just handed over to him, away.\nThe assistant thought that Huo Zheng had already finished going through the documents so he said, \u201cThe general manager of Tuyuan just called to invite you out for lunch to discuss the cooperation.\u201d\nHuo Zheng rose to his feet and put on his coat as he said curtly, \u201cTomorrow.\u201d\nThe assistant nodded and checked Huo Zheng\u2019s schedule before saying, \u201cYou\u2019re free tomorrow morning. WIKA wants to have a conference call with us, and they\u2019re free to do it any time so we can do it now.\u201d\nHuo Zheng looked at his assistant with a hint of pity as he said, \u201cI don\u2019t have time today.\u201d\n\u201cAre you leaving?\u201d the assistant asked, stunned, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing on your schedule now. Did I miss anything?\u201d\nMeanwhile, the secretary had just skimmed through the documents. He was in charge of the internal work of the company and also handing tasks from the upper management to the lower management. When he first came in and saw the neat stack of documents, he had already felt that something was amiss. When Huo Zheng was speaking to his assistant, he had briefly flipped through the documents and found that there was no signature on them. He asked politely, confused, \u201cThe documents seem\u2026 untouched?\u201d\nHuo Zheng nodded, looking a little proud as he said, \u201cThat\u2019s right. I\u2019m going on a date.\u201d\nAs he walked to the door, he pointed at the documents and said before he left, \u201cI\u2019ll leave these to you.\u201d\nAssistant Song stared at the closed door in shock. \u201cThe boss actually skipped work so openly?!\u201d\nThe secretary massaged his temples as he said, \u201cI was hoping to get off work early so I can have a candlelight dinner with my girlfriend tonight.\u201d\n\u2018Great. The boss is free and happy, but who knows how long I\u2019ll have to work overtime today?\u2019\nThe secretary complained, \u201cDon\u2019t workers deserve to celebrate Valentine\u2019s Day as well?\u201d\n\nAssistant Song was single. He naturally was unaware that it was Valentine\u2019s Day until he heard the secretary\u2019s words. It was not strange to him that Huo Zheng left to celebrate Valentine\u2019s Day with Lin Xiaowan. He calmly changed Huo Zheng\u2019s schedule and left to arrange everything.\nWhen Huo Zheng was waiting for the elevator, he received a message from Lin Xiaowan.\n[Lin Xiaowan: Are you still at the company? Don\u2019t work anymore. I\u2019m going to do what I want today. I\u2019m going to bring you out to play. I\u2019m already on my way to you. I\u2019ll wait for you at the entrance of the company. I\u2019m driving the huge silver Mulsanne.]\n[Lin Xiaowan: I meant the driver is driving, not me. Don\u2019t worry.]\nLin Xiaowan did not have a driving license and usually traveled using public transportation in the past.\nHuo Zheng smiled as he read her messages. He went to the ground floor and took a seat by the window where he had a good view. The window was a one-way glass so he could sec the situation outside clearly.\nWhen the receptionist saw Huo Zheng, she hurried over and asked, \u201cPresident Huo, would you like something to drink?\u201d\nHuo Zheng waved his hand. \u201cNo need. I\u2019m waiting for someone.\u201d\nThe receptionist was at a loss. Although Huo Zheng refused, she still served him a glass of water in the end. She did not know his preference so it was safest to go with a glass of water.\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Huo Zheng said with a slight nod.\nThe receptionist blushed and quickly returned to her post with her heart thumping wildly.\n\u2018Heavens! Although the boss looks cold, he\u2019s really polite. However, his aura is so strong that I don\u2019t dare to look at him at all! I wonder who he\u2019s waiting for? After all, he personally came down here to wait for the other party\u2026\u2019\nHuo Zheng was waiting, and so was the curious receptionist.\nAfter a while, a silver Mulsane slowly pulled to a stop in front of the entrance.\nA smile appeared on Huo Zheng\u2019s face immediately, and his aura seemed to soften. Just as he stood up, he saw the back door of the car open. He saw a young woman dressed in an apricot trench coat alighting from the car, and he was filled with anticipation. He wondered if she would take the initiative to look for him in the company. Lin Xiaowan rarely came to his company so he really wanted to use this chance to show everyone that she was the wife of the boss of Huo Group.\nAlas, Huo Zheng\u2019s expectations were dashed. After alighting from the car, Lin Xiaowan suddenly ran to the side after closing the door.\nHuo Zheng shook his head helplessly and quickly walked out. When he walked out, he finally saw what Lin Xiaowan was doing. At the intersection nearby, she was buying cotton candy from a stall..\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

I\u2019ll wait for the madam.\u201d\nThe driver quickly returned to the driver\u2019s seat.\nAt this time, Lin Xiaowan returned with her cotton candy. When she saw Huo Zheng, she quickly stuffed it into her mouth.\n\u201cIt\u2019s too sweet,\u201d Huo Zheng said with a frown. After all, cotton candy was made of sugar and had no nutritional value.\nLin Xiaowan scoffed and carried the cotton candy into the car.\nHuo Zheng followed her in and asked, \u201cDo you like the cotton candy or the roses?\u201d\nHuo Zheng was naturally talking about the champagne roses that he had given her this morning.\nLin Xiaowan decided to give him more sweetness on Valentine\u2019s Day so she kissed him and said, \u201cI like Brother the most!\u201d\nIn Huo Zheng\u2019s opinion, even honey was not half as sweet as Lin Xiaowan.\nHuo Zheng\u2019s gaze softened, and he felt his heart melting. He quickly leaned over and kissed her again.\nIt had only been about five minutes since Huo Zheng left, and the receptionist had been secretly observing him the entire time. She could not sec what happened in the car, but she could clearly see the change in Huo Zheng\u2019s expression and his interaction with the mysterious young woman.\nShe was extremely excited. She thought that it was unfortunate that it was working hours now so she had no one to share her excitement with.\nShe tried to calm down for a long time, but she kept recalling what she had seen. In the end, she quickly entered the group chat with a few dozen people and sent a few messages consecutively.\n[Receptionist: Guess what I saw? The boss actually left during working hours to meet a mysterious woman!]\n\n[I\u2019m so excited right now! It\u2019s too bad no one was around, and I was the only one who saw it!]\n[The boss hugged the woman and even ate the cotton candy she handed over! After that, the two left in the car affectionately!]\nOnly a few minutes had passed when the replies came.\n[Little Zhang: I just came out from the morning meeting. Which boss are you talking about?]\n[Little Wu: Are you talking about President Huo? You\u2019re saying he\u2019s not single?]\n[Little Liu: Didn\u2019t President Huo bring his girlfriend previously to the annual gala? Is it the same woman?]\n[Little Zhang: Where are you? This is big news!]\nIt took a long time before the receptionist finally replied.\n[Sorry, I was busy with work earlier.]\n[Yes, I\u2019m talking about President Huo! I didn\u2019t see the woman during the annual gala so I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re the same person. The woman today was standing too far away so I didn\u2019t have a good look as well! (crying).]\n[She\u2019s slender and very fair. It\u2019s sunny today so she looked like she was glowing under the sun!]\n[Little Wu: I just came to the toilet to gossip. What else do you have?]\n[Little Liu: Your description matches the woman from the annual gala. According to one of our colleagues, President Huo\u2019s female companion was extremely fair and beautiful.]\nThe receptionist continued to type on her phone.\n[The boss was really gentle! He was completely different from his usual aloof and taciturn self!]\n[Little Zhang: How could he treat his girlfriend the way he treats us? (sigh) Today is Valentine\u2019s Day. The boss is probably going on a date!]\n[Little Liu: Tell me more. I\u2019m going to post it on our company\u2019s forum later! Hehehe!]\n[Little Wu: Stop slacking off. In any case, tell us more! I\u2019ll read it when I\u2019m done with my work! ]\n\n[Staff Xiao Wu: You can\u2019t slack off anymore. Say more. I\u2019ll read it at noon.]\nLin Xiaowan brought Huo Zheng to a crowded mall in the city center. The cinema was located on the fourth floor of the mall. She passed her bag to him and said seriously, \u201cAs a boyfriend, you have to take the initiative to carry your girlfriend\u2019s bag.\u201d\nHuo Zheng was more than 1.8 meters tall. No matter how one looked at it, he looked a little funny carrying a small sequined bag. However, he did not refuse and allowed Lin Xiaowan to mess with him.\nWhen they arrived at the fourth floor, the smell of snacks permeated the air. Although it was a working day, there were still quite a lot of people because it was Valentine\u2019s Day.\nThe two of them picked up their tickets from the machine. There was still half an hour left before the movie started.\nLin Xiaowan glanced at the food counter a few times before she cleared her throat and said, \u201cYou know, you have to be more proactive when you\u2019re out on a date with a girl. I\u2019ve already bought the tickets\u2026\u201d\nLin Xiaowan gestured with her hand before she continued to say, \u201cShouldn\u2019t you do something in return?\u201d\nHuo Zheng naturally knew what she was thinking. He extended his hand with his palm facing up as he said, \u201cIf you want to eat snacks, you\u2019ll have to pay for them, right?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan did not follow his train of thought and assumed that he wanted her to pay for the snacks. She looked at him foolishly and said, \u201cMy wallet is in the bag.\u201d\nHuo Zheng sighed before he leaned over and held her hand. He said, \u201cThe payment is holding hands. Why are you so slow?\u201d\nHuo Zheng spoke very affectionately to her, and Lin Xiaowan found it rather novel. He had never spoken like that in the past. He had really changed and did seem so reserved anymore. She quickly reached out to hold his hand before she said, \u201cYou\u2019re the slow one. You\u2019re the slowest person in the world!\u201d\nHuo Zheng only smiled at her and did not say anything.\nLin Xiaowan had chosen a highly-rated romance film. In the past, she rarely watched romance films. She thought that they were too fake and unrealistic, and she could not relate to them at all. However, she thought differently now that Huo Zheng had changed. She was actually looking forward to watching the movie with him.\nLin Xiaowan hugged the bucket of popcorn and French fries to her chest and ate them with relish as she said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t like the movie or have any opinion, you can tell me.\u201d\n\u201cAlright,\u201d Huo Zheng said as he lifted a cup of milk tea and placed it by her lips, \u201cHave a sip. You can\u2019t drink this often. You have to drink more water.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan quickly took a few gulps. She felt very happy until the second half of Huo Zheng\u2019s words quickly deprived her of her happiness. She said happily, \u201cWhy? It\u2019s not like I drink this often!\u201d\nHuo Zheng wanted to say again that there was no nutritional value, but he did not want to spoil the mood. Finally, he said, \u201cYou can tell the chef at home to make it for you.\n\u201cHow can it be the same?\u201d Lin Xiaowan protested, \u201cMoreover, you shouldn\u2019t snatch business opportunities away from the milk tea vendors!\u201d\nHuo Zheng felt helpless; there was nothing he could do about her. If the doctor had any concerns about her health during her checkup in a week, he would have to be stricter with her..\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

Lin Xiaowan chose the seats in the middle. Apart from a young couple on the left, the other seats were empty.\nThe young couple was wearing matching jackets, and Lin Xiaowan felt a little envious. Unfortunately, Huo Zheng rarely dressed so casually. He lived in his suits almost all year round. During autumn and winter, he would add a cashmere coat. The colors of his clothes were usually dark, making him look very mature.\nHuo Zheng noticed that Lin Xiaowan kept sneaking glances at him so he asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan cast a sidelong glance at him and said, \u201cYou said you\u2019re 26, right? Your birthday is in June. This means that you\u2019ll turn 27 soon.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\n\u201927? I supposed he won\u2019t dress in that kind of casual clothes, right?\u2019 Lin Xiaowan sighed inwardly, feeling a little regretful. When she met Huo Zheng, he was already the president of the company. She could not help but wonder how he looked dressed in his uniform when he was young and carefree. He was likely as eye-catching as he was now.\n\u201cThere are three months left until then. Is there anything you want?\u201d\nHuo Zheng had never lacked material things since he was young. Lin Xiaowan knew she would have to work hard when looking for a gift for him.\nThe two-hour movie ended very quickly.\nWhen Lin Xiaowan was researching movies to watch, she had read the reviews for this movie. She had seen many reviewers say that they were very touched by the movie and that it reminded them of their youth. At that time, she did not think much about the reviews at all.\n\nHowever, when she watched the ending now, she could not accept it and could not help but complain, \u201cWhy aren\u2019t they together? How can they not love each other? Did the second female lead write the script?\u201d\nThe movie was very melodramatic. The male and female leads were childhood sweethearts, and the male lead had been especially good to the female lead since they were young. He took care of her very well, and they got together naturally. However, after they got engaged, a female schoolmate from the past suddenly appeared next to the male lead. He treated the other party very well, and all his meticulous care for the female lead seemed to have been given to the other party. When the female lead found out about it, she thought about it the entire night before she talked to the male lead. In the end, she decided to part ways with him.\nIn fact, the male lead was just used to having the female lead around. He realized that his feelings for the female lead were familial, not the love between a man and a woman. He only figured this out when he met the second female lead, who made his heart race. He was still coming to terms with this when his talk with the female lead finally made him face his true feelings honestly.\nIn the end, the female lead went abroad to further her studies, leaving the place that made her sad. At the same time, the second female lead confessed to the male lead in the end.\nThe only thing that barely appeased Lin Xiaowan was the fact that that was where the movie ended. It did not show if the male lead accepted the confession or not. Those like her who could not accept the ending could only console themselves in this manner.\nLin Xiaowan thought to herself angrily, \u2018I don\u2019t understand why this movie is highly rated! The plot is too melodramatic!\u2019\nOn the contrary, Huo Zheng was very calm. The couple seats were connected so he lifted Lin Xiaowan\u2019s legs and placed them on his lap. She was wearing lambskin boots today, and the shoelaces had come undone so he slowly tied them for her.\nThe couple on the left was just about to leave when the girl saw this scene. She nudged her boyfriend with her elbow and said, \u201cLook at how good her boyfriend is!\u201d\nThe boy smiled sheepishly and quickly held his girlfriend\u2019s hand.\nAt this time, the ending theme song was still playing on the screen, showing many stills of the male lead and the female lead when they were young.\nSuddenly, Lin Xiaowan was a little curious, and she asked a deadly question. \u201cHey, if Song Zhiyi were the second female lead and I were the female lead, would you like me?\u201d\n\u201cOf course. However, this is just a movie. Don\u2019t take it so seriously,\u201d Huo Zheng said helplessly. No matter whether it was real life or the movie, he would always love her.\nAfter the theme song ended, Lin Xiaowan finally rose to her feet. Huo Zheng helped her tidy her clothes and wiped her hands with wet tissues before he took the initiative to throw the trash away.\nLin Xiaowan touched his coat pocket and exclaimed in surprise, \u201cYou actually brought wet tissues?\u201d Then, she added in a regretful tone, \u201cIf only I had met you when I was still in school.\u201d\n\nHuo Zheng replied in a low voice, \u201cIn our next life\u2026\u201d\n\u2018In our next life, I want to meet you earlier so I can protect you\u2026\u2019\nAt this time, Lin Xiaowan thought of something and asked, \u201cHey, how\u2019s Song Zhiyi now?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. Perhaps she\u2019s in prison,\u201d Huo Zheng replied vaguely.\nHuo Zheng was not telling the truth.\nInitially, Song Zhiyi was imprisoned in Qin Yanchuan\u2019s territory according to Huo Zheng\u2019s instructions. At a fixed time every day, food would be brought to her.\nAfter dealing with the Dong family, Huo Zheng showed up and took Song Zhiyi away. He brought her to the place where Lin Xiaowan was once imprisoned before he tied her up and tossed her in there. He could not find the poisonous gas that Dong Xianghang prepared back then so he asked someone to make something similar before releasing it inside.\nThe wound on Song Zhiyi\u2019s hand had not been treated so it was festering and turning necrotic. It was already bad when she was imprisoned in Qin Yanchuan\u2019s territory, and her situation took a turn for the worse in this place. At first, she kicked up a fuss, crying and screaming. However, in just half a day, the poisonous gas had affected her greatly. She could hardly speak and see. Even her hearing and sense of smell were greatly dulled.\nHuo Zheng hated Song Zhiyi to the core and did not want her to have an easy or quick death. As such, every day, someone would come to treat her and bring her food before the torture started all over again. If she refused to eat, they would force her to eat through feeding tubes.\nAfter two weeks of torture, Huo Zheng finally returned her after two weeks of living hell. Qin Yanchuan then handed her over to the police with more than ten charges, including kidnapping and attempted homicide.\nSong Zhiyi died on the eve of the lunar new year. Perhaps due to the festivity, the management was a bit lax. While people were not looking, she went to the highest floor and jumped to her death.\nWhen Qin Yanchuan informed Huo Zheng about it, he had responded indifferently. However, he would occasionally fall into a trance, surprised by his own ruthlessness. At the same time, he also wondered if he was only together with Song Zhiyi in the past because she had pursued him relentlessly and enthusiastically. Just like Lin Xiaowan\u2019s assessment of him, perhaps he was really too gullible when he was young.\nMeanwhile, Lin Xiaowan looked at the claw machine on the first floor filled with small plush toys and said, \u201cHuo Zheng, let\u2019s play that! Have you ever played with a claw machine? It\u2019s said that newbies are especially lucky!\u201d\nHuo Zheng returned to his senses and saw Lin Xiaowan skipping toward the counter to exchange for game coins. He followed her and said tenderly, \u201cDon\u2019t run.\u201d\nHuo Zheng did not mean to lie to Lin Xiaowan. He just did not want her to know about those filthy things. He also had his own selfish reason. He was afraid that she would be afraid of him if she knew what had happened.\nIn fact, Lin Xiaowan was not the only one who felt regretful. Huo Zheng felt regretful as well. How good would it be if he had met her when he was in school? Fortunately, he still met her in the end. It was not too late for him to love her..\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

When she got up early in the morning, she squinted her eyes sleepily and quickly sent a message to Gu Yuwu saying that she would not be going to the set today. After sending the message, she lay back down in bed and planned to continue sleeping.\nAt this time, Huo Zheng, who had just gotten dressed, walked in. He saw her lazing in bed and leaned over to kiss her before he said, \u201cRemember to cat breakfast later.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan hummed twice.\n\u201cI have a gift for you. It\u2019s on the table outside.\u201d\nUpon hearing these words, Lin Xiaowan opened her eyes. She looked half-awake as she yawned and asked, \u201cWhat gift? Didn\u2019t you already give me one yesterday?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan was still sleepy so she did not listen to Huo Zheng\u2019s words carefully. She hugged the blanket and fell asleep in just a few seconds.\nAt 8.30 AM, the new nanny knocked on the door to wake Lin Xiaowan up. Huo Zheng had instructed her to wake Lin Xiaowan up so she would not skip breakfast.\nLin Xiaowan checked her phone first and saw Gu Yuwu\u2019s teasing reply. After getting out of bed, she brushed her teeth and washed her face. When she walked outside, she finally saw an exquisite box on the small coffee table. It was only then that she remembered Huo Zheng\u2019s words earlier in the morning. She took a closer look and found that it was a Patek Philippe watch.\nLin Xiaowan did not know why Huo Zheng would suddenly give her a watch. She took a photo and sent a message to him to ask about it. His reply came very quickly. He sent a photo of his hand; he was wearing a watch that was quite similar to hers. They were global limited edition couple watches.\nLin Xiaowan was delighted when she saw this and quickly sent him another message. She was naturally delighted that he took the initiative to buy a couple\u2019s items.\nTo be honest, the watch was not very appropriate for work nor was it in the style that he usually liked. However, he had done this for Lin Xiaowan. He had noticed her looking at the couple who wore matching outfits yesterday and understood her thoughts.\n[Huo Zheng: If you like it, we can wear matching clothes as well. I\u2019ll leave it up to you. It doesn\u2019t just have to be clothes. You can buy whatever you want.]\n[Lin Xiaowan: I\u2019ve just given you extra points for this, and I\u2019m giving you more points!]\n\nThe clothing brands that Huo Zheng wore were all exceptional. She had been with him for about five years so her standards had also risen. She was browsing around when a his-and-hers coat caught her eye. However, she felt a little speechless when she saw the price.\nHuo Zheng had supported her since she graduated. She was a little worm with no ambition and was just muddling along in life. However, at this moment, she felt that maybe she should look for a job.\n\u2018However, what can I do?\u2019 Lin Xiaowan frowned in confusion.\nIn the past, she had studied business administration, thinking that she would work as a secretary after graduation. However, she met Huo Zheng after that and had lived a carefree life since. Thinking about having to work from nine to five and maybe even overtime, she was subconsciously resistant to the idea. She would no longer be able to sleep in or do whatever she wanted.\nLin Xiaowan sighed.\nA few days later.\nGu Yuwu called Lin Xiaowan and asked her to come to the set.\nLin Xiaowan perked up and asked, \u201cIs it time for me to shoot my scenes?\u201d\nGu Yuwu replied, \u201cNo. I need you to sign a contract and calculate your salary.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll be paid?\u201d\n\u201cOf course. Did you think actors act for free?\u201d\nWhen Lin Xiaowan arrived, she followed Gu Yuwu to a room. She was shocked when she saw how much she was going to be paid.\n\u201cI\u2019m actually getting paid tens of thousands of yuan?!\u201d\nLin Xiaowan was not even a celebrity, but she was getting paid so much. She could not imagine just how much famous celebrities earned. It must be in the millions or tens of millions.\n\u2018No wonder everyone wants to be a celebrity!\u2019\nLin Xiaowan was a complete amateur. How could she be paid so much? She only paid so much thanks to Gu Yuwu\u2019s care for her. Since Gu Yuwu would be paying the salary, who dared to comment about Lin Xiaowan\u2019s pay?\nLin Xiaowan excitedly signed her name on the contract.\n\nGu Yuwu was amused by her. \u201cI haven\u2019t even explained the details of the contract to you yet, but you\u2019ve already signed it. Aren\u2019t you afraid that I\u2019ll sell you off?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan giggled. \u201cThere\u2019s so much money. It\u2019s fine even if you sell me!\u201d\nGu Yuwu shook her head helplessly before she said, \u201cIt\u2019s fine that you act this way with me. However, you mustn\u2019t be like this in the future, especially when dealing with others. You have to get a lawyer to take a look at the contract first and make sure there\u2019s no problem before signing it, understand?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan did not think there would be another occasion where she had to sign a contract again. After all, she was not working. Moreover, if there was a next time, she had a feeling that it would also be with Gu Yuwu. For this reason, she did not take Gu Yuwu\u2019s words to heart. At this moment, her entire person was bubbling with happiness. It was as though she had discovered a treasure.\n\u201cYou\u2019re so happy with the tens of thousands of yuan?\u201d Gu Yuwu commented, puzzled.\nAfter all, the wealth that the Huo family had accumulated over the generations was unimaginable. Not only that, but if Huo Zheng were to make a move, it was likely that the entire economy in Shangxia would be affected. Just one of Huo Zheng\u2019s custom cars was at least eight figures. Even his cufflinks could be put up for auction. So why did Lin Xiaowan look as though she was in dire straits?\nGu Yuwu asked skeptically, \u201cDoesn\u2019t Huo Zheng let you spend money?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan was still immersed in happiness. When she heard Gu Yuwu\u2019s question, she was stunned. \u201cHe does.\u201d\nApart from the black card that Huo Zheng gave her when they met, he also gave her another card that was bound to her phone. He had taught her how to bind the card to her phone. A large amount of money would be credited into the account. At that time, he had casually said that it was her pocket money. She had been dumbfounded when she saw the amount of money. Her daily expenditure was not even a fraction of what was given to her every time.\nGu Yuwu frowned. \u201cThen why does it seem like you\u2019re in need of money?\u201d\n\u201cAh, that\u2019s not the case,\u201d Lin Xiaowan said, looking embarrassed, \u201cIt\u2019s because I\u2019ve never earned so much money on my own before. That\u2019s why I\u2019m a little excited.\u201d\nThe money she earned in school when she worked part-time was very little. She had never earned more than 200 yuan a day.\nAfter a moment, Lin Xiaowan said, \u201cSpeaking of, I\u2019ve been looking for a job recently. Do you have any recommendations?\u201d\nGu Yuwu looked at her skeptically and asked, \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re really not short of money?\u201d\nSeeing that Gu Yuwu was skeptical and worried, looking as though she was going to fight with someone on her behalf, she hurriedly said to reassure Gu Yuwu, \u201cI\u2019m sure. It\u2019s just that I haven\u2019t been working. It was fine before, but now that I think about it, it\u2019s not good.\u201d\n\u201cThen, do you have anything you like to do or want to do?\u201d Gu Yuwu asked.\nThis question silenced Lin Xiaowan immediately..\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

She sadly realized that she did not have anything she liked that could be turned into a job.\nSeeing her silence, Gu Yuwu said, \u201cYou have to choose a job that you like. Otherwise, every day will be a torture. Do you have any hobbies?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan thought about her hobbies before she said, \u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t seem to be good at them though\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s so difficult about that? You can always learn!\u201d\n\u2018But what should I learn?\u2019\nLin Xiaowan felt a little troubled. She liked drawing, but she also liked musical instruments and photography. Learning how to farm or bake sounds fun as well. She sighed heavily.\nGu Yuwu looked at her with a questioning gaze.\nLin Xiaowan reflected on herself and said with a sigh, \u201cI\u2019m too indecisive and fickle-minded. I want to learn everything\u2026\u201d\nGu Yuwu laughed. \u201cYou can\u2019t say that. It\u2019s not fickle or indecisive; it\u2019s called having a wide range of interests. Moreover, you have to try many things to find out what you like.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan nodded thoughtfully and asked, \u201cDid you try a lot of things before?\u201d\nGu Yuwu thought about it for a moment before she said, \u201cOf course. I wanted to learn many things when I was a kid\u2026 Hmmm, when was it\u2026 I think when I was in the second or third grade, I insisted on learning how to play the drums. I thought it\u2019d look cool for a girl to play drums.\u201d\nGu Yuwu laughed before she continued to say, \u201cHowever, after a few months, I quit because I fell in love with Latin dance costumes. After that, I went to learn Latin dance.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not all. I later found Latin dance classes tiring so I stopped going. Not long after that, I saw a classmate of mine who always participated in chess competitions. I thought he looked really impressive and cool so I learned that as well!\u201d\nLin Xiaowan\u2019s eyes widened, and she felt a little envious. It was amazing that Gu Yuwu could learn whatever she wanted. Not only did she feel stupid because she had a difficult time learning in school, but she also did not have the money for tuition, let alone for hobby classes.\nGu Yuwu thought about her past willful self, and many memories flooded her mind. Looking back, she realized she had many experiences when she was young. She said, \u201cI learned chess for a few years and quit when I was in the sixth grade. At that time, I wanted to learn to play the piano because I thought that I\u2019d look like a princess.\u201d\n\u201cAt the same time, I also picked up drums again and worked very hard. I even formed a band with a few of my classmates in junior high school. We even participated in many competitions and won many awards!\u201d\n\nUp until now, Gu Yuwu still had yet to speak about photography so Lin Xiaowan was curious how Gu Yuwu became interested in photography.\nCoincidentally, Gu Yuwu said at this time, \u201cDuring the summer break in my first year of high school, I visited a meadow. It was evening when I arrived. I remember I was amazed when I got out of the car and looked at the sky. With the way the clouds were scattered in the sky at sunset, it felt as though I was looking at two worlds. One side of the sky was blue while the other side was tinged with red and orange from the setting sun. At that time, I thought to myself it would be a pity not to capture such a scene. Gradually, I began to learn photography. This hobby continued even after I graduated from university\u2026\u201d\nAt night.\nLin Xiaowan moved to Huo Zheng\u2019s side and leaned against him, looking listless.\nHuo Zheng, who was reading an industry analysis report, pinched her nose and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. You can continue reading your report. I\u2019ll watch you.\u201d\nThe report was written in a foreign language with professional jargon. It would have been strange if Lin Xiaowan could understand it.\nHuo Zheng put the report aside. Thinking that Lin Xiaowan was bored, he said, \u201cI heard you earned a lot of money today.\u201d\n\u201cThese words sound really strange coming from you. You earn much, much, much, much, much more money than me,\u201d Lin Xiaowan said, repeating the word \u2018much\u2019, \u201cWhen you praise me like that, it doesn\u2019t sound sincere.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m sincerely praising you.\u201d\nAfter a moment, Lin Xiaowan said, \u201cI want to learn how to draw.\u201d\nHuo Zheng nodded without hesitation. \u201cAlright. I\u2019ll look for a teacher for you tomorrow.\u201d\n\u201cI also want to learn photography.\u201d\n\u201cOkay.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026 I also want to learn to play the piano!\u201d\n\u201cOkay.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about learning how to play drums?\u201d\n\u201cOkay.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan reached out and patted his body with a suspicious expression as she said, \u201cIs there a recorder hidden on you? Do you only know how to say the word \u2018okay\u2019?\u201d\n\nHuo Zheng looked at her indulgently and said, \u201cYou can learn whatever you want. Why reason is there for me to say no?\u201d\n\u2022\u2022\nThe next day, Huo Zheng really found a teacher for Lin Xiaowan.\nThe other party was an old professor from the Shengjing Academy of Fine Arts. She was a kind-looking old lady. She was thin and small, and she was dressed very well. She was a fashionable old lady. Despite her age, she was strong. When she spoke, she was very gentle.\nWhen she was approached by accepting a student, she did not agree immediately. Instead, she said she wanted to meet Lin Xiaowan first before making a decision.\nHuo Zheng asked Lin Xiaowan if she wanted to meet the professor, and Lin Xiaowan was shocked.\n\u201cYou found a teacher so quickly?!\u201d\nThey had just spoken about this the night before, and the conversation was very casual. He continued to ask about what she wanted to learn, and she kept coming back to drawing and painting. Before they could talk more about it, she had fallen asleep. She did not expect Huo Zheng to work so fast.\n\u201cThis teacher is very good at drawing portraits as well. Why don\u2019t you meet her first?\u201d\nIn the end, they met in an empty studio in the Shengjing Academy of Fine Arts.\nLin Xiaowan did not have any experience at all, and she was going to meet such a professional as soon as she started. It was not surprising that she was nervous. Her starting point was too high after all.\nThe professor did not put on any air and looked at Lin Xiaowan kindly as she said, \u201cDon\u2019t be nervous. Why don\u2019t you tell Grandma why you want to learn painting and drawing?\u201d\n\u2018Grandma?!\u2019\nLin Xiaowan became even more nervous. Was it not impolite to address the other party so casually?\n\u201cI\u2026 I just think that paintings are very beautiful. The mix of colors is really beautiful,\u201d Lin Xiaowan said, not knowing how to express her thoughts.\nThe professor smiled kindly and handed her a sketchbook and a few art supplies. \u201cJust draw or paint something for me to have a look.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan really had no experience at all. She had briefly experimented with acrylic paint; that was all. She knew nothing about drawing or the various media of painting.\nShe instinctively looked at Huo Zheng for help.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. You can draw whatever you want.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan still did not dare to move. She looked at the smiling professor blankly.\nThe professor said encouragingly, \u201cJust draw. This sketchbook belongs to you now so you can do whatever you want. It doesn\u2019t matter even if you fill the entire page with colors without drawing..\u201d\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

She drew a colorful abstract flower. If it was hung up for exhibition, one would not know what it was without an explanation.\nThe old professor looked quite satisfied. \u201cThis little girl\u2019s painting is quite unique. She\u2019s quite good.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan did not know the reasoning behind the praise, but she was still happy to be praised.\nAfter that, the two chatted. It was a simple question-and-answer session. After that, the professor accepted her as a student.\n\u201cAlright, you\u2019re not bad. From now on, you\u2019ll have to address me as teacher,\u201d the old professor said with a smile, \u201cIf you want, you can also call me Grandma. I have a few students who address me as Grandma Hong.\u201d\nThe professor\u2019s name was Hong Minhua.\nAfter that, Hong Minhua gave Lin Xiaowan a name card. The name Xiao Han was printed on it, and there was also a string of numbers.\n\u201cThis is my student. He\u2019s the most patient one among all my students. I don\u2019t know what kind of art style you like, but his foundation and sketches are top-notch. Let him teach you the basics first. I\u2019m old so I don\u2019t have the mindset of young people like you. If you have any questions, you can come to me. Don\u2019t feel embarrassed. When you\u2019ve learned the basic brush strokes, I\u2019ll teach you some color techniques.\u201d\nHong Minhua brought her tablet out and skillfully opened his social media QR code and said, \u201cCome here. I\u2019ll give you my contact information.\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Lin Xiaowan said, reaching out to Huo Zheng to ask for her phone. She had handed her bag to him earlier.\nThis was Hong Minhua\u2019s first time accepting a student who did not go through the systemic learning process. She had more than ten students, and all of them were art students. Lin Xiaowan was naturally different from those people.\nWhen Huo Zheng contacted Hong Minhua previously, he had told her that there was no need to be too strict with Lin Xiaowan. After all, it was not like Lin Xiaowan was going to make this a career or hoping to gain fame and success. Instead of saying she was teaching Lin Xiaowan, it was more like she was asked to look after a good friend\u2019s child. For this reason, she did not assess Lin Xiaowan like she would her students and only treated Lin Xiaowan as a junior.\n\nLin Xiaowan listened to instructions very well. She had a keen sense of colors and had her own ideas. However, if she were to be judged professionally, she definitely was not qualified to be a student of Hong Minhua.\nNonetheless, Hong Minhua quite liked Lin Xiaowan. She was very satisfied that the younger generation took an interest in art.\nAfter exchanging contact details, they had lunch together. It was only then that Lin Xiaowan found that Hong Minhua had known the Huo brothers for a long time now. She sighed inwardly, \u2018It seems like everyone from aristocratic families run in the same circle\u2026\u2019\nDuring lunch, Hong Minhua grew fonder and fonder of Lin Xiaowan as they spoke. She only had a son, and her son and daughter-in-law also gave birth to a son. She really wished she had a daughter or granddaughter whom she could spoil. It was not that she did not like boys, but it would be perfect if she had a girl as well.\nApart from that, it was not like there were no girls at Lin Xiaowan\u2019s age around her. However, girls raised in aristocratic families were very serious and ambitious. To put it bluntly, they were not fun to play with and could not be teased casually. This set Lin Xiaowan apart from them.\nHong Minhua picked up a piece of vegetable with her chopsticks and placed it in Lin Xiaowan\u2019s bowl as she said, \u201cEat more vegetables.\u201d\nHong Minhua saw the reluctance on Lin Xiaowan\u2019s face, but in the end, the latter still nodded and thanked her softly. Then, the latter lowered her head and ate the vegetables obediently like a hamster.\nAfter that, Hong Minhua looked at Huo Zheng and hinted to him to pour some drinks for Lin Xiaowan.\nWhen Lin Xiaowan saw the glass, she quickly held it with both hands and gulped it down to wash off the taste in her mouth. Then, she looked at the dishes on the table and bit her chopstick, wondering what to eat next.\n\u2018How amusing\u2026\u2019\nAt this moment, Huo Zheng patted Lin Xiaowan\u2019s hand and said, \u201cDon\u2019t bite the chopstick.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Lin Xiaowan replied, looking aggrieved.\n\u2018The professor is still here. Can\u2019t he just let it go for this once? Can\u2019t you see the professor is laughing at me? There\u2019s also the drinks earlier. Why did he pour me such a small glass when we ordered a big jug? Why can\u2019t I have more? Why did he place the jug on his side? He must be enjoying this, right?\u2019\nLin Xiaowan felt like deducting all his points at this moment.\nHong Minhua\u2019s gaze softened even more as she thought to herself, \u2018How cute!\u2019\n\nHong Minghua picked up a piece of honey-glazed pumpkin for Lin Xiaowan.\nLin Xiaowan smiled sweetly and said, \u201cThank you, Teacher!\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be so formal,\u201d Hong Minhua said, \u201cJust call me Grandma Hong. That\u2019s good enough.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan felt awkward and wondered if it was appropriate. However, when she saw the expectant expression on Hong Minhua\u2019s face, she said shyly, \u201cThank you, Grandma Hong.\u201d\nAfter lunch, Hong Minhua only had one thought in her mind.\n\u2018It\u2019s good to have a young girl to tease\u2026\u2019\n\u201cIf you have any problems, come and look for Grandma. If you have nothing to do, you can also look for me,\u201d Hong Minhua said, a little reluctant to part with Lin Xiaowan. Her attitude had changed completely.\nIf Lin Xiaowan were to draw an abstract and completely unrecognizable flower in front of Hong Minhua now, she would not only say that Lin Xiaowan had a unique insight. She would have praised Lin Xiaowan as an artistic genius.\nIn Hong Minhua\u2019s opinion, she was teaching a junior, not a student. It was only natural to give a little encouragement when teaching a junior. So what if the compliment was a little exaggerated?\nHong Minhua\u2019s grandson was in his second year of high school. She calculated his age and Lin Xiaowan\u2019s age before she sighed in regret.\n\u2018Alas, the age isn\u2019t suitable\u2026\u2019\nLater on, Lin Xiaowan forgot about the flashy name card that Hong Minhua gave her. She only remembered it when Hong Minhua sent her a message saying that she had told Xiao Han to expect her call. Then, she quickly sent a reply.\n[Lin Xiaowan: Yes, Teacher.]\nLin Xiaowan even added a cute emoji.\nAt the same time, Hong Minhua showed her grandson the message and said, \u201cLook, look at this cute emoji! I can even imagine how cute she looks when replying to my message!\u201d\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

He was very athletic and was particularly good at playing basketball. Girls would often come to watch his games. Some of them would even give him gifts. He was always surrounded by girls, and he felt like they were too noisy. Even his username was \u2018Women Are So Annoying\u2019.\nWhen his father found out about it, his father had laughed at him, saying that he did not know how to enjoy his high school life.\nLin Xiaowan added Xiao Han\u2019s contact information before she sent in a message. To show her friendliness, she even sent him a cat emoji.\n[LinXiaowan: Hello!]\n[Xiao Han: Hello. Teacher has already told me about your situation. When is it convenient for us to meet?]\n[Xiao Han: You don\u2019t have any foundation at all, right?]\nAlthough Hong Minhua had said that Xiao Han was patient and had a good temper, Lin Xiaowan still could not help but feel a little nervous when she saw the second message. She was worried that the other party would despise her lack of foundation. What if the other party did not want to teach a stranger?\nLin Xiaowan\u2019s back was very straight as she typed her reply.\n[Lin Xiaowan: That\u2019s right. I have no foundation\u2026\u201d\n[Xiao Han: That\u2019s fine. Let\u2019s start by understanding different types of painting media. Do you have time tomorrow?]\n\u2018Hm? His attitude is really good!\u2019\nTo begin with, texting was not as good as communicating face-to-face, but when Lin Xiaowan saw the latest reply, she relaxed immediately.\n\n[Lin Xiaowan: Give me a minute. Let me check.]\nLin Xiaowan had not been to the set for two days. The last time she called Gu Yuwu, she learned that she might be filming her scenes soon. She quickly called Gu Yuwu to check her schedule.\nGu Yuwu had not heard from Lin Xiaowan for a few days so she asked, \u201cWhat have you been up to the past two days?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan told Gu Yuwu about Huo Zheng finding her an art teacher. She laughed and said, \u201cMy teacher asked one of her students to teach me the basics. The student asked if I have time tomorrow.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry. We definitely won\u2019t be filming tomorrow. Today\u2019s Friday\u2026 Hmm, I\u2019ll speak to the director and arrange for you to come on Monday. At that time, you\u2019ll try on your costumes and makeup so we can see if there\u2019s any problem. You can get a feel for things first\u2026\u201d\n\u201cOkay, then keep me updated!\u201d\n\u201cAlright.\u201d\nAfter ending the call, Lin Xiaowan replied to Xiao Han. They agreed on a time and place to meet. He asked her where she was staying and if it was convenient to meet at Nanhu Road.\n[Xiao Han: Shall we meet at the studio on 77 Nanhu Road?]\n[Lin Xiaowan: Okay! What should 1 bring?]\nLin Xiaowan had seen art students carrying huge bags with their easels and painting supplies in the past. She wondered if she should buy more art supplies.\n[Xiao Han: It\u2019s fine. Just bring yourself.]\nAfter that, Lin Xiaowan had nothing to do so she searched Hong Minhua for more information. When the results returned, she was shocked.\nAs it turned out, the teacher Huo Zheng found for her was one of the heads of Shangxia Artist Association. She was also the vice president of Shengjing Art Association, and she had her own teaching and research office in Shengjing Academy of Fine Arts.\nApart from personal information, there was also a long list of Hong Minhua\u2019s credentials.\nLin Xiaowan\u2019s eyes widened in shock. The article listed Hong Minhua\u2019s works that won numerous awards. The list of awards she had won was seven or eight lines long. Her works were exhibited both locally and internationally. There was a link to the photos of her paintings.\n\n\u2018She\u2019s a big boss!\u2019\nAfter looking through Hong Minhua\u2019s works, Lin Xiaowan\u2019s heart thumped heavily. She really did not expect Huo Zheng to find her such an outstanding teacher. She sighed when she thought about how terrible her painting was today. She did not even know how to hold a brush properly. She wondered what kind of benefits Huo Zheng gave Hong Minhua to make I long Minhua accept her as a student. Moreover, Hong Minhua even praised her.\nLin Xiaowan felt crying as the pressure on her grew. At the same time, she felt incredibly lucky. Fortunately, Hong Minhua had entrusted her student to teach her the basics first. 0then-vase, she would feel incredibly nervous about being taught the basics by someone like Hong Minhua.\nLin Xiaowan felt like she had taken advantage of Hong Minhua. Her students were all talented and likely fought hard to become her students. However, she was given a shortcut.\nLin Xiaowan closed the browser page and felt that sometimes people should not be too curious. Before searching Hong Minhua, she only thought that Hong Minhua was a very good person for accepting her as a student. However, knowing what she knew now, she wanted to cry but had no tears. She thought that Hong Minhua was not just a good person, she was practically a saint for accepting her as a student.\nAfter a while, Lin Xiaowan thought about searching Xiao Han\u2019s name, but she quickly dismissed the idea after two seconds and put her phone down.\n\u2018Forget it. What if I find information 1 can\u2019t accept again\u2026\u2019\nLin Xiaowan was supposed to meet Xiao Han at 9 AM.\nAfter having breakfast with Huo Zheng, she suddenly transferred tens of thousands of yuan to him.\nHuo Zheng looked at the amount of money she transferred him before he looked at her with question marks above his head.\nLin Xiaowan coughed and said, \u201cThis is your service fee.

Find you more art teachers?\u2019\nLin Xiaowan had transferred Huo Zheng the exact amount of money that she would be paid for her role as the goddess. However, she had yet to receive her salary. After all, she had not even begun filming yet. The money was transferred from the daily card Huo Zheng gave her. To put it bluntly, she had transferred Huo Zheng\u2019s money to Huo Zheng.\nLin Xiaowan did not sound very confident as she said, \u201cYou can use the money to buy something for yourself to eat\u2026\u201d\nHuo Zheng did not refuse her and accepted the money. At the same time, he decided to buy some cakes for her before coming home later..\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

Unsure, she took a photo and sent it to Xiaohan along with a message.\n[Lin Xiaowan: Is this the place? ]\n[Xiao Han: Yes. Have you arrived? I ll come out and get you.]\nLin Xiaowan got out of the car and stood by the roadside for less than a minute before a tall boy with thick eyebrows and big eyes walked out. He was wearing a dark sweater and a jacket. He looked around, and when he saw there was only one other person present, he quickly strode over to Lin Xiaowan.\nAt the same time, Lin Xiaowan was stunned.\nXiao Han is a man?\u2019\nWhen Xiao Han appeared in front of her, he smiled kindly, faintly revealing a canine tooth on one side as he asked, \u201cAre you Lin Xiaowan?\u201d\n\u201cAh, 1 am,\u201d Lin Xiaowan said, slightly embarrassed, \u201cI thought you were a girl. \u2018\nXiao Han laughed. \u201cWhy did you think so? This is the first time someone has thought so\u2026\u201d\nXiao Han usually posted a few photos in his social circle, and there were quite a few photos of him in the circle. As such, his gender was very obvious. It was the first time that someone thought he was a girl.\nLin Xiaowan did not know how to respond. When she heard the name Xiao Ilan1, she felt that the name belonged to a girl. Moreover, she usually did not post anything in her social circle so she rarely checked others\u2019 social circles.\nAfter the small interlude, Xiao Ilan led Lin Xiaowan into the studio and said, \u201cThis studio belongs to Teacher Hong. Many students usually come here for lessons or to practice before their exams. However , Teacher Hong herself rarely comes here.\u201d\n\n\u201cI see,\u201d Lin Xiaowan replied. She thought that the studio\u2019s name, Unnamed, was quite interesting. She thought it gave off vibes similar to Untitled Poems\u2019 by Li Shangyin.\nThe studio was decorated very tastefully. It was colorful, and there was a wall that displayed the students\u2019 award-winning works.\nAs they chatted, Lin Xiaowan discovered that Xiao Han had already graduated. She assumed he was still a student due to his youthful appearance. She said, \u201cYou\u2019ve graduated? Then, I\u2019m not disturbing your work, am 1?\u201d\n\u201cNo. Moreover, most of my work is done here.\u201d\nThey walked to the end of a corridor and turned a corner before entering a small room with a huge window facing north. The room was not tidy. The faint smell of sandalwood mixed with paint and thinner permeated the air, and painting tools and various materials were scattered around the room. Many paintings were also hung on the wall. Although it looked messy, everything seemed to have its own order. Two easels were lined in front of the window, and the canvasses on them had already been painted on.\nXiao Han planned to familiarize Lin Xiaowan with the basic tools first so he brought three pieces of paper out and said, \u201cFeel it, and see what the difference is\u2026\u201d\nLin Xiaowan touched them carefully and said, \u201cThis one seems to be smoother\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Xiao Han nodded before he explained, \u201cWatercolor paper is usually divided into three types. The one that feels smoother is called wood pulp paper, and it\u2019s also slightly harder. The roughest one is called cotton pulp paper; it\u2019s much softer, and it also has the best absorption among the three types of paper.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan nodded. \u201cOh, what about the third one?\u201d\n\u201cThe third one is a blend between wood and cotton pulp. It falls between the two,\u201d Xiao Ilan said. After that, he brought out five brushes of different sizes and showed them to Lin Xiaowan as he said, \u201cLook at these five brushes. What\u2019s the difference?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan studied the brushes carefully and seriously for a long time before she said with uncertainty, \u201cTheir sizes are different?\u201d She reached out to poke them and continued to say, \u201cThey\u2019re all hard.\u201d\nXiao Han laughed. \u201cIt\u2019ll become soft when you soak in water.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan really did not know what the difference was. She said, \u201cThe thickness is different? I really don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d\nThen, she picked the biggest brush and said, \u201cThis one is square, and the others are pointy\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYes, the square one is called a flat brush,\u201d Xiao Ilan said. Seeing that she was most interested in the flat brush, he started by introducing the flat brush first.\n\nAfter introducing her to the brushes, Xiao Han then showed her different types of watercolors and other media.\nLin Xiaowan was dizzy from all the information. Her attitude of a bad student showed up when the sun shone into the room, making it warm. She yawned twice, looking sleepy as she listened. When she thought about the types of paper that Xiao Han introduced in the beginning, she could no longer remember anything. She sighed and murmured to herself, \u201cThere are so many things\u2026\u201d\nLin Xiaowan was feeling a little hungry, and she suddenly asked, \u201cWhat are you going to have for lunch?\u201d\nXiao Han seemed unaffected by the abrupt change in topic. \u201cHmm? I haven\u2019t thought about it.\u201d He glanced at the clock on the wall and saw that it was now 11.30 AM so he said, \u201cLet\u2019s eat first.\u201d\n\u201cOkay!\u201d Lin Xiaowan agreed immediately. There were many options when eating outside. She quickly brought her phone out to check if there were any good restaurants around as she asked, \u201cWhat do you feel like eating?\u201d\nXiao Han was amused when he saw how energetic Lin Xiaowan became when lunch was mentioned, no longer looking as listless as before.\nInitially, Xiao Han only planned to casually order takeout for lunch. However, seeing how expectant Lin Xiaowan was, he asked, \u201cIs there anything you feel like eating? I\u2019m quite familiar with this area.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan was someone whose eyes were bigger than her stomach. Apart from that, she also had a tough time deciding on what she wanted to eat.\nSeeing Lin Xiaowan\u2019s indecisiveness, Xiao Ilan asked, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we go out and have a look?\u201d\n\u201cAlright,\u201d Lin Xiaowan said with a hurried nod before she added, \u201cI\u2019ll treat you to lunch!\u201d\nXiao Han chuckled and said, \u201cIt\u2019s fine. I can still afford to pay for lunch. Moreover, you\u2019re Teacher Hong\u2019s student. This means you\u2019re my junior sister. I low can 1 let my junior sister treat me to lunch? 1 should be the one treating you.\u201d\nThe driver parked the car at the entrance of the studio. When he saw Lin Xiaowan walking out, he came out and opened the car door for Lin Xiaowan.\nUpon seeing this, Lin Xiaowan hurriedly said, \u201cI\u2019m not going back yet. 1 just came out for lunch. You don\u2019t have to wait for me here. Go and eat. I\u2019ll let you know when it s time to leave.\u201d\nThe driver nodded but did not leave. He returned to the car and continued watching the livestream that he had been watching earlier.\nIn fact, the driver\u2019s work was usually very leisurely. When he was waiting for his employer or when his service was not needed, he could do whatever he wanted as long as his work was not affected..\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

The driver was a middle-aged man. No matter how he looked at it, the age did not seem to match. However, the middle-aged man seemed too young to be Lin Xiaowan\u2019s father.\n\u201cNo, no, he\u2019s my driver. He usually fetches me around when I go out,\u201d Lin Xiaowan explained as she followed Xiao Han down a small path.\n\u201cI see,\u201d Xiao Han said with a nod.\nThe small path was bustling and noisy, completely different from the quiet Nanhu Road.\nAfter walking a few steps, Lin Xiaowan smelled a distinct and alluring fragrance in the air, which caused her stomach to growl. She gulped and said, \u201cSomething smells good\u2026\u201d\nIt was very obvious when she gulped. She was so attracted by the fragrance that she stood still for a long time. She sniffed and looked around like a dog, trying to determine the source of the fragrance. There were many small shops here so it was a little difficult for her to determine which shop the fragrance came from.\nXiao Han frequented this place all the time so he understood with just a glance. He said, \u201cI think you\u2019re looking for Fan Jixian Restaurant. Do you want to have a look?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan looked around for the restaurant that Xiao Han mentioned, but she did not see it. \u201cWhere is it? I don\u2019t see it\u2026\u201d\nXiao Han quickly led the way.\nEven before they reached the entrance of the shop, Lin Xiaowan had already confirmed that the fragrance indeed came from the shop. The closer they got, the stronger the fragrance was. When they reached the entrance, she felt as though an invisible hand was pulling her into the restaurant.\nXiao Han said, \u201cFan Jixian serves freshly stewed chicken soup every day at noon, and it\u2019s famous for its chicken mushroom soup noodles.\u201d\nThe restaurant was an old and famous noodle shop with two floors. As soon as one stepped into the restaurant, one could feel the weight of time. The shop was passed down for three generations. It started with just a small stall by the roadside, and the large pot of chicken soup placed at the side had a fragrance that could spread for ten miles.\n\nLin Xiaowan could not wait to enter the restaurant, but she restrained herself and asked Xiao Han politely, \u201cDo you mind eating here or do you want to eat something else?\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s eat here. I\u2019ll have some noodles,\u201d Xiao Han replied.\nWhen they entered the restaurant, the smell of the chicken soup was even stronger.\nApart from the signature chicken mushroom soup noodles, there were other kinds of noodles as well.\nA leaderboard hung on the wall behind the counter. A small line of words could be seen at the bottom: Every Monday, the data will be reset. It displayed the sales volume of the different varieties of noodles on the menu for the week. The chicken mushroom soup noodle was far ahead of the other noodles, and their sales were a digit more than the Yangchun noodles that were in second place.\nAfter Lin Xiaowan placed an order for a large serving of chicken mushroom soup noodles, she saw the number next to the chicken mushroom soup noodles on the leaderboard increase by one, and she was amused.\nAfter Xiao Han placed his order, Lin Xiaowan ordered a bottle of soda and asked, \u201cDo you want a drink?\u201d\nXiao Han shook his head and asked the lady behind the counter how much it was.\nThe lady behind the counter asked, \u201cAre you paying separately or together?\u201d\nXiao Han and Lin Xiaowan both replied in unison to pay together, but Xiao Han was a step slower than Lin Xiaowan. While he was bringing out his phone, Lin Xiaowan had already paid the bill.\nLin Xiaowan looked triumphant, clearly happy that she beat Xiao Han to pay the bill first. She asked, \u201cWhere should we sit?\u201d\nXiao Han did not know whether to laugh or cry when he saw this, and he quickly led her to a table.\nThe lady boss of the shop opened the old-fashioned soda bottle for Lin Xiaowan and gave her a straw before she said, \u201cOur chicken soup is free. You can try it later. It\u2019s delicious, and a hundred times better than soda.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan nodded as she took a big gulp of the soda. \u201cOkay.\u201d\nAfter taking a seat, Lin Xiaowan sent a message to Huo Zheng, telling him about the noodle shop.\n\n[Lin Xiaowan: I\u2019m waiting for my food. The noodles smell extremely good. I wonder if it\u2019ll taste good as well.]\nAt this time, Xiao Han said, \u201cI already said that I\u2019ll treat you to lunch, but you still paid for it.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan deliberately rushed to pay for the food. She said tactfully, \u201cYou\u2019re teaching me so it\u2019s only right that I treat you to lunch.\u201d\nXiao Han propped his chin on his hands and looked at Lin Xiaowan.\nThey were sitting by the window, and the sunlight streamed in, shining on Lin Xiaowan. She held the soda bottle and drank it all in one go. When she was done, she turned to the side before letting out a small burp.\nAt this time, Xiao Han asked, \u201cWhy did you want to learn how to paint?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan replied, \u201cI just think it\u2019s very beautiful. I\u2019ve always been interested in painting. It\u2019s just that 1 never had a chance to learn. I thought about it and felt that it\u2019s never too late to learn\u2026\u201d\nIn fact, when Xiao Han learned that Hong Minhua wanted him to teach a friend\u2019s friend the basics, he was slightly unhappy. It was still a long time before the academy would recruit students, but Hong Minhua accepted the other party as a student so he thought that the other party must have an extraordinary background. Not only that, but the other party also did not have any foundation. It was obvious that the other party was not like Hong Minhua\u2019s other students.\nHe also assumed, for some reason, that the other party was a child. He was not good with children and would subconsciously treat them coldly and perfunctorily. At that time, Hong Minhua had told him that the other party was a young woman about his age, and he also realized he had assumed wrongly.\nWhen he finally met Lin Xiaowan, he was quite surprised. Just as Hong Minhua said, she was very well-behaved. He had told her there was no need to bring anything, but she still brought a bag of supplies. He thought that she looked very cute when she waited for him by the roadside earlier, looking at a loss.\nWith that, he quickly accepted this \u2018illegitimate junior sister\u2019.\nMeanwhile, Lin Xiaowan who had finished the bottle of soda contemplated whether she should get another drink or listen to the lady boss\u2019 suggestion and try a bowl of chicken soup. However, she felt like she should finish her noodles first before drinking the soup. In the end, she decided to get a bottle of flavored milk.\nUpon seeing this, Xiao Han suddenly smacked his forehead. \u201cAre you very thirsty? I\u2019m sorry I forgot to offer you water earlier. We have a water dispenser in the studio.\nLin Xiaowan was indeed thirsty, but it had nothing to do with whether he served her water or not earlier. She replied, \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I just really like these drinks.\u201d\n\u201cYou should drink less sugary drinks. If you drink too much, your teeth will fall out,\u201d Xiao Han said jokingly.\nLin Xiaowan had just unscrewed the cap and had taken a big gulp when she heard this. She froze, not sure if she should continue drinking or not.. She was in a dilemma for a moment before she defended herself with great difficulty, \u201cI\u2026 I rarely drink them\u2026\u201d\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

Let\u2019s start with basic sketching.\u201d\n\u201cHuh? Do I need to learn sketching before learning how to paint with watercolor?\u201d\nXiao Han laughed. \u201cOf course. No matter what, you need to know how to sketch at the very least. You don\u2019t have to be very good. You can learn the structures of things and shading\u2026\u201d\n\u201cOh, okay.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan held the pencil as though she was writing, waiting for Xiao Han to tell her what to do next.\nHowever, when Xiao Han saw the way she held the pencil, he could not help but laugh. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to hold it like this. Relax. Drawing is a very relaxing activity.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d Lin Xiaowan looked a little embarrassed. She followed his example and quickly adjusted her grip.\nWhen it was dusk, Xiao Han turned on the lights in the studio. He stretched and said, \u201cLet\u2019s call it a day. I didn\u2019t expect your endurance to be so good.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan smiled. She naturally had a lot of patience for things that she was interested in.\nXiao Han said, \u201cWe won\u2019t spend too much on sketching. You should familiarize yourself with it first. After that, 1\u201911 teach you how to sketch the human body.\u201d\nAs he led Lin Xiaowan out, he said, \u201cI\u2019ll give you a drawing book for line practice later. You can practice your strokes.\u201d\n\u201cOh, okay.\u201d\n\u201cAlright. We can continue the lesson tomorrow if you don\u2019t have any plans. Or you can contact me whenever you\u2019re free,\u201d Xiao Han said.\n\u201cOkay, thank you!\u201d\nLin Xiaowan did not have much to do every day. As such, over the next few days, she would wake up and finish her breakfast before messaging Xiao Han to ask if he was free for lessons.\n\nIt was not like Xiao Han had never taught students before. He worked in the studio, and there were also classes being held at the studio. However, this was the first time he was asked every day if he was free for lessons. As time passed, he began to look forward to the notification on his phone every morning.\nAfter a few days of lessons, Gu Yuwu informed her that she would begin shooting her scenes soon.\nLin Xiaowan felt like a long time had passed since she had gone to the set. Now that she heard that filming was about to start, she could not help but feel nervous.\n\u201cCome over tomorrow. You can try on the costumes to familiarize yourself with them. You should also get to know a few of the leads. There\u2019s one who\u2019s a little difficult, but she\u2019s preoccupied with the other actors so you don\u2019t have to worry. Just follow me tomorrow, and I\u2019ll introduce you.\u201d\nAfter that, Lin Xiaowan informed Xiao Han that she would not be able to go for her lesson tomorrow. However, she did not specify the reason.\nXiao Han was also very understanding. As adults, they had their own things to do. Nonetheless, he still felt a bit disappointed. He quickly replied to her and did not ask any questions.\nHe sighed inwardly. \u20181 guess there won\u2019t be any notification tomorrow.\u2019\nGu Yuwu picked Lin Xiaowan up in the morning. She had told Lin Xiaowan not to put on any makeup.\n\u201cToday, you\u2019ll try on the makeup for the goddess,\u201d Gu Yuwu said, pinching Lin Xiaowan\u2019s cheek, \u201cI told you not to put on makeup today because it\u2019ll end up getting removed anyway. By the way, you have really good skin.\u201d\nWhen they arrived, the main leads were already in the midst of filming.\nLin Xiaowan searched through her rather bad memory, but she could not figure out which scene they were filming today. After all, filming was never done according to the sequence of the plot.\n\u201cYou see that young master? With him at the center, the one standing on his left is the first female lead, the one on his right is the second female lead, and the one behind him is the third female lead,\u201d Gu Yuwu said as she pointed at a few people in the distance.\nThe first and second parts of the drama were arranged according to the number of scenes the characters had.\nLin Xiaowan could easily match the three women with the three female characters in the drama. She recognized two out of the three women. The first female lead was the youngest person to win the Best Actress award for a movie. The other person she recognized was the third female lead who looked aloof. She had watched a few of the third female lead\u2019s works, and she found the latter very unique. She even searched for the other party\u2019s edits on the Internet.\n\u201cThe person in front of the young master is the fourth male lead. You see the person sitting at the side? He\u2019s the male lead, but he\u2019s not filming now. As for the sixth male lead, he\u2019s not here today. Even if he were, you won\u2019t recognize him since he\u2019s a newbie,\u201d Gu Yuwu said before adding, \u201cLet\u2019s go. I\u2019ll bring you to do your makeup first.\u201d\n\u201cDo goddesses also need makeup?\u201d\nGu Yuwu chuckled. \u201cOf course. What if you don\u2019t wear makeup and the others look better than you?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan nodded. \u201cYou\u2019re right. Even goddesses need makeup.\u201d\nThe costume for the goddess was rather complicated.\n\nLin Xiaowan put on layers of clothes which were finally topped with a pink and white wide rope. After putting on her costumes, she felt like she had gained several kilograms. She was also wearing a huge golden headpiece on her head. Although it was not made from real gold, it was still very heavy.\nLin Xiaowan raised her hand to support the headpiece, feeling as though it was going to fall.\nCurrently, her makeup was not completed. Based on the character of the goddess, she had to have golden patterns painted on her neck, arms, and bare feet. These were the incantations of the curse. Since they were not filming her scenes today, they did not draw the golden patterns. It would be too long of a process after all.\nWhen she came out, she seemed to be glowing.\nGu Yuwu clapped her hands and said, \u201cYou\u2019re really suitable for this role! You look so beautiful!\u201d\nLin Xiaowan was very beautifully dressed compared to the leads. After all, the leads were mostly fighting and killing on their journey to the divine realm. Their makeup and costumes naturally reflected that. This comparison also served as a contrast to her role as the goddess.\nMeanwhile, Lin Xiaowan asked in confusion, \u201cWhy don\u2019t the goddess wear shoes?\u201d\nIn the drama, the goddess did not wear shoes.\nAt this time, Lin Xiaowan sat at the side, trying to immerse herself in the character as the filming went on.\nThere were not many people around at this moment since they were busy with filming the scenes so she was very relaxed. She brought her phone out to take a selfie. After all, how often would she be dressed in such a manner? Moreover, the makeup artist and a few people had praised her for her beauty earlier so she was feeling a little proud.\nAt this moment, Gu Yuwu said, \u201cLet me show you the script. You might need to film later.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan swayed her feet as she asked in confusion, \u201cI thought you said that I won\u2019t have to film today?\u201d\nMeanwhile, Fu Hua, one of the costume designers, stroked her chin, sizing Lin Xiaowan up. After a moment, she tied a string of small silver bells around Lin Xiaowan\u2019s ankle.\nLin Xiaowan stopped swaying her feet and asked, \u201cThis\u2026 Won\u2019t this make too much noise when filming?\u201d\nThe divine realm was vast, but there was only the goddess alone in the divine realm. Later on, when the main leads came, there would only be ten of them altogether. If she made the slightest moment, the bells would ring immediately.\nLin Xiaowan shook her head and added, \u201cWouldn\u2019t it affect the majesty of the goddess?\u201d\nGu Yuwu looked at Lin Xiaowan, feeling very satisfied. She felt as though she was looking at the goddess herself at this moment.\nFu Hua, a middle-aged woman, studied Lin Xiaowan again with the character of the goddess in mind. Although she felt that the anklet was aesthetically pleasing, it indeed did not suit the aloof character of the goddess. She removed the anklet and said with a sigh, \u201cIt\u2019s indeed not very suitable.\u201d\nGu Yuwu had a few things to discuss with the scriptwriter. She handed the script to Lin Xiaowan and said, \u201cDon\u2019t bother with the plot for now. Just try to get a feel of the state the goddess is in\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Lin Xiaowan said with a nod. Her expression turned serious, and she straightened her back as she looked through the script..\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

She held the script, feeling a little lost. Seeing that there were so many people, she was not sure if she should continue sitting here or change places.\nThe staff members also did not expect there to be another person and were slightly stunned when they saw her. As they worked, they could not help but glance at her.\nLin Xiaowan bit her lip. She felt uncomfortable being stared at, but she tried not to show her discomfort. She tried to force herself to calm down, telling herself that she would also be stared at by so many people when filming started for her.\nShe hyped herself up as the staff members moved the props and examined the set. After a moment, she leaned forward and asked the person closest to her, \u201cAre you filming here?\u201d\n\u201cNot now. We\u2019re setting up first to shoot later,\u201d the staff member replied.\nLin Xiaowan was rather surprised that the staff member seemed rather nervous speaking. The latter\u2019s eyes darted all over the place, shuffling her feet and twiddling her fingers. For some reason, seeing that the latter was also like her, she felt less nervous. With this, she could not help but smile.\nThe staff member, also a young woman, saw Lin Xiaowan\u2019s smile and said, \u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful. What role are you playing?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just playing a small role,\u201d Lin Xiaowan replied vaguely. She was not sure if she could casually reveal her role.\nThe staff member seemed to understand and did nor ask any questions. She smiled before she left to work.\nLin Xiaowan felt less nervous after this encounter. After thinking about it for a while, she mustered up her courage and raised her head to look around, observing the people in the room. It did not take long for her to discover that she was nor rhe only person who felr uncomfortable.\nA few people who met her gaze smiled at her while a few, who were even more nervous than her, hurriedly averted their eyes. However, no matter how they were, none of them showed any malice or disdain. They mostly only looked at her with surprised or curious gazes.\nLin Xiaowan found that she did not mind these gazes as much as she thought she would.\nAt this moment, the director walked in and saw Lin Xiaowan sitting leisurely with her chin propped on her hand. She held the script with one hand while she swayed her feet. He did not walk over and continued to observe her. He could somewhat see where Gu Yuwu was coming from, but he did not agree with her completely.\nGu Yuwu had expressed to him that she wanted to add more scenes for Lin Xiaowan. She suggested adding a plot that contrasted the goddess\u2019 aloof character. She wanted to show the goddess\u2019 liveliness and innocence when the goddess just ascended to the divine realm. She wanted to show the transformation of the cheerful goddess to the cold and emotionless goddess in the later stage.\nSince filming had only started not long ago, it was not impossible to change the script. However, after careful consideration, the director decided nor to add more scenes for the goddess. In his opinion, if they were to shoot the origin of the goddess, it would take away the mystery of the goddess. Moreover, it also felt very forced to him.\nAfter thinking about it for a long time, he looked for Gu Yuwu and expressed his thoughts to her before he said, \u201cIt\u2019ll be better if we film that scene as an extra. I think that rhe effect will be much better than incorporating it into the drama.\u201d\nGu Yuwu nodded, agreeing with the director.\nThe director smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s good working with you, President Gu. At least we can communicate effectively to solve problems. It\u2019s really great.\u201d\nThe director was sincere. In other production teams, the words of the investors were like imperial edicts. Investors would add people or scenes as they pleased without asking for opinions. Sometimes, the entire production would be greatly affected because of this.\n\nGu Yuwu, on the other hand, was very different. Her existence was reassuring, and she seemed genuinely interested in the filming. Moreover, she always discussed her ideas with the crew and did not unilaterally impose her idea on them.\nGu Yuwu looked at the directors from the corners of her eyes. She did not dwell on his words. She said casually, \u201cMy temper has calmed down a lot over the past two years. You should know what it was like in the past.\u201d\nIndeed, Gu Yuwu was rather fierce in the past. During filming, she was even scarier than the director. As soon as she opened her mouth, many people would feel ashamed. She did not hold back and would even drive away terrible actors after she scolded them. If they still wanted to cause trouble, she would not hesitate to deal with them. Once she made a move, there would be a bloody storm.\nEveryone in the industry knew what kind of person Gu Yuwu was. No matter how famous and glorious someone was, if they joined her production, they still had to act dutifully.\nGu Yuwu rose to her feet and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go and have a look. Let\u2019s see if the goddess has adapted to her role.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan was doing well initially, but the appearance of a few other people made her nervous again.\nThe main leads usually would not wander around after they were done shooting their scenes. They would get their makeup touched up and rest.\nWhen Chang Ning, the third female lead, heard the crew talking about how beautiful the goddess was, she grew curious. She had filmed a few scenes in the divine realms before this, but rhe goddess had yet to show up. She asked a few people about it, but no one knew anything. After finding out that the goddess was on set today, she wanted to have a look since she was on a break. However, she was too embarrassed to go over directly.\nChang Ning looked aloof and arrogant so many people assumed she had a bad temper. However, the truth was she had a very good personality. She was especially good to those around her.\nChang Ning looked for He Qianyuan, another lead, to join her.\nHe Qianyuan was new to acting, and she was two years younger than the twenty-year-old Chang Ning. For this reason, she found it difficult to refuse Chang Ning when Chang Ning invited her to look for Lin Xiaowan. Moreover, she was not resistant to the suggestion and was on a break so she nodded in agreement.\nThe duo had just taken a few steps when they ran into a few male actors. They were rather young. When they heard that the duo was going to look for the goddess in the drama, they were also interested and decided to tag along.\nLin Xiaowan was happily observing the others when she saw a few main leads walking in. She was stunned and froze immediately.\nThe few of them saw Lin Xiaowan as soon as they entered. With the unique and gorgeous pink and white robes that were embroidered with golden threads, coupled with the gorgeous golden headpiece that was sparkling under the light, she looked extremely eye-catching. She was completely different from what they had imagined when they discussed the plot..\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

She looked at them and listened silently. It was obvious that she did not know what to say.\nGu Yuwu saw Chang Ning leaning next to Lin Xiaowan and felt more assured. She knew that Chang Ning was in fact very down-to-earth and had a good personality. The latter was not scheming and was very good at maintaining the atmosphere. She strode over and asked, \u201cHave you gotten familiar with everyone?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan\u2019s eyes lit up as soon as someone she knew arrived. With someone to rely on, she immediately lost her timid appearance.\nAfter chasing the others away, Gu Yuwu informed once again that the filming of her scenes would only start tomorrow. She took a seat next to Lin Xiaowan and asked, \u201cIt\u2019s not that scary, right? The number of people when filming tomorrow is more or less the same. The only difference is they\u2019re working now, but tomorrow, their focus will be on you while they work.\u201d\nAfter that, Gu Yuwu continued to say, \u201cCome on, show me how you look as a goddess.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan was not very good at meeting people\u2019s eyes. It was even more difficult for her to look at someone condescendingly and arrogantly. As such, she stared ahead at the ground and pursed her lips slightly. After a moment, she felt a little discouraged and said, \u201c1 think 1 need to work harder. What if I don\u2019t do well tomorrow? With so many people staring at me, I\u2019m afraid 1 won\u2019t perform well.\u201d\nIn fact, Lin Xiaowan already had a certain understanding of the character she was playing. She also had her own idea on how to interpret the character. However, no matter what, she had no foundation in acting at all. Along with a few other personal reasons, it was only natural that she lacked confidence.\nGu Yuwu thought about it for a moment before saying, \u201cYou have a one-on-one scene with the priestess tomorrow. You just met her. Chang Ning is playing the priestess. You can try practicing with her.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan knew that watching and experiencing it for herself was very different. She gritted her teeth and nodded. \u201cAlright.\u201d\nChang Ning played the part of the third female lead. She was arrogant and cold, and it seemed like she could see through things with just a glance. Her words were also blunt and cold. However, in fact, she was very considerate and cherished the people around her a lot. She was the kind of person who was cold on the outside but warm on the inside.\nGu Yuwu said, \u201cThere\u2019s be a lot of scenes during tomorrow\u2019s shoot. There will be a lot of takes. There will be people with cameras next to you to take close-up shots\u2026\u201d She gestured around at the staff members and continued to say, \u201cI won\u2019t ask the staff members to leave when you practice with Chang Ning so you can get used to it, okay?\u201d\n\nLin Xiaowan wanted to test herself as well so she nodded. \u201cOkay.\u201d\nGu Yuwu praised her immediately. \u201cYou\u2019re doing great, Xiaowan. You sat here in your costumes in front of so many people, and you were also okay with being watched. You even agreed to practice with Chang Ning. It\u2019s already very impressive. Don\u2019t worry about doing well. You\u2019ve already done very well.\u201d\nGu Yuwu gave Lin Xiaowan a thumbs-up when she spoke.\nA smile appeared on Lin Xiaowan\u2019s face immediately. Clearly, she liked being praised.\nWhen Chang Ning appeared again, she was still wearing a blue brocade robe and black boots. The brocade robe was embroidered with a soaring white crane. Her hair was pulled up into a high ponytail with a red crown. She was dressed very differently from the other two female leads. She was dressed more valiantly.\n\u201cHello, Goddess, we meet again!\u201d\nChang Ning strode over with a smile on her face. Although they had just met, there was no sense of alienation at all.\nLin Xiaowan tidied her clothes and said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry to trouble you with this\u2026\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s no trouble at all. It\u2019s my honor to be able to practice with you,\u201d Chang Ning said as she moved to stand in front of Lin Xiaowan.\nAs soon as she stood in front of Lin Xiaowan, her smile vanished immediately, and her tone was a little disdainful as she said, \u201cMay I know why the Divine Goddess wishes to speak to me in private?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan was shocked by Chang Ning\u2019s abrupt change in attitude. It took a while for her to realize that Chang Ning had gotten into character. Fortunately, her script was flipped open to the page of this scene. She glanced at it and stammered, flustered, \u201cY-you\u2026 You seem to have forgotten your duty as a priestess.\u201d\nAfter saying this, Lin Xiaowan immediately covered her face and apologized. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry. 1 was caught off guard earlier.\u201d\nChang Ning smiled and said, \u201cIt\u2019s okay. This is very normal. Everyone\u2019s like this in the beginning.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan was truly shocked by the speed that Chang Ning got into character. During the first few days of filming, she did not see Chang Ning act. Today was the first time she had seen Chang Ning acting. Chang Ning was calm, composed, magnanimous, and brave.\nChang Ning was very different from the character she played, but she could get into character so quickly. She was relaxed, and her control was very good. Her emotions were also very good. All in all, she grasped her character very well.\n\nLin Xiaowan took a deep breath and said, \u201cLet\u2019s try again.\u201d\nThe two young women practiced over and over again even though it was just a very brief scene. Although Lin Xiaowan only had a few lines, Chang Ning patiently accompanied her to practice. They even discussed the character of the goddess and the reason why the goddess decided to sacrifice her divine bone to help everyone in the end.\nLin Xiaowan shared her thoughts. \u201cI think the goddess doesn\u2019t like her life very much. Look, the cultivation world is so big, and there are countless sects. As such, the divine realm must be even bigger. However, she\u2019s alone in such a huge place; there\u2019s no one around her at all. There\u2019s nothing she can do but watch what\u2019s going on in the lower realm every day.\u201d\nChang Ning nodded. \u201cYes, yes, that\u2019s what 1 thought as well. When we opposed her and she stopped helping us to kill demons, 1 suspect that she did it out of boredom and just wanted to see us in a sorry state.\u201d\nChang Ning nudged Lin Xiaowan and asked teasingly, \u201cTell me, what are you thinking? Did you laugh out loud when you saw us fleeing for our lives, injured? Was it amusing?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan instinctively shook her head. \u201cNo, no, not at all\u2026\u201d\nAfter a while, Lin Xiaowan could recite her lines smoothly, but when faced with Chang Ning, her aura was still a little too weak. She was supposed to be the goddess, but her aura was suppressed by Chang Ning. If there were other people in the scene, it might not be too bad. However, in a one-on-one scene with Chang Ning, the difference in aura would be very obvious.\nLin Xiaowan felt a little discouraged. She asked curiously, \u201cHow did you do it? You\u2019re able to get into character so quickly\u2026\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about your state of mind,\u201d Chang Ning said seriously, \u201cI think I\u2019m Feng Xiaohe. When I say my lines, I\u2019m Feng Xiaohe. 1 don\u2019t treat you as Lin Xiaowan, but I treat you as the goddess.\u201d\nFeng Xiaohe was the name of Chang Ning\u2019s character in the drama.\n\u201cYou have to think of yourself as the goddess to play this role well,\u201d Chang Ning said, \u201cIn fact, it\u2019s a little like playing a murder mystery game. Have you played it before?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan shook her head, but she roughly understood Chang Ning\u2019s meaning.\nChang Ning clicked her tongue. \u201cIf there\u2019s a chance, let\u2019s play together next time. You\u2019ll understand what 1 mean then.\u201d\nChang Ning continued to say, \u201cLet me give you a simple example. When we discussed the plot, stop referring to the goddess as \u2018she\u2019, and use T instead.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan thought about it for a moment before she said, \u201c1 feel like the divine realm is really lonely. 1 helped you in the end, because without my help, all of you would be forced to separate. All of you would be doomed to guard the realms and experience the same loneliness as 1 did\u2026\u201d\nChang Ning clapped her hands and looked at Lin Xiaowan with approval as she said, \u201cGood job!\u201d\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

When she returned home at night, she brought the script with her, hoping to rehearse with Huo Zheng.\nHuo Zheng raised an eyebrow, flipping through the script.\n\u201cWhich character should I play?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan was most familiar with Feng Xiaohe, whom Chang Ning played. She pointed and said with a smile, \u201cLet\u2019s rehearse these lines.\u201d\n\u201cThis seems to be a female character?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s right. Brother, you won\u2019t mind it, right?\u201d\nAs time passed, Lin Xiaowan had grown more and more unrestrained when she was with Huo Zheng. When she needed something, she would address him as \u2018brother\u2019. Even her tone would change when she spoke to him.\nFaced with this, Huo Zheng was helpless against her. He was in a state where he was ruthlessly controlled by the word \u2018brother\u2019.\nHuo Zheng held the script and slowly read out the lines that Lin Xiaowan had pointed out earlier. He raised an eyebrow and looked at her indifferently as he said, \u201cI wonder what the goddess has to say to me in private?\u201d\nThe script was not rigid. As long as the lines retained their original meaning, it was fine to change them occasionally. For example, when Lin Xiaowan was rehearsing with Chang Ning during the day, Chang Ning would change her lines, but the meaning was still the same.\nLin Xiaowan was surprised by Huo Zheng\u2019s performance. He had said the lines very naturally. He leaned against the couch and rested his elbow on the side; his posture did look awkward at all. For a moment, her brain seemed to have short-circuited, causing her to forget her lines. She blushed and said, \u201cLet me look at my lines again.\u201d\nHuo Zheng silently watched as Lin Xiaowan took a seat, cleared her throat, and read the lines a few times. After a moment, he read his lines again.\nLin Xiaowan tried to immerse herself in her character. She furrowed her eyebrows and said disapprovingly, \u201cYou seemed to have forgotten your responsibility as a priestess. You\u2019ve sullied your divinity by hanging around those people.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Huo Zheng replied indifferently, \u201cDivinity is meaningless to me, and I\u2019ve never cared about being a priestess.\u201d\n\nThen, Huo Zheng looked up with a glint in his eyes and an insouciant smile before he continued to say, \u201cHowever, I do have a way to change the goddess\u2019 opinion of me.\u201d\n\u2018Huh? Why is this line so different from what I remember?\u2019\nLin Xiaowan moved closer to Huo Zheng to have a look at the script.\nSeeing that Lin Xiaowan took the initiative to move closer to him, he lowered his head and gently kissed her ear.\nLin Xiaowan felt his warm breath, and she shivered, struggling to read the script in her hand. This script was the one that Gu Yuwu had asked the director to give her, and she had read it page by page earlier. She did not remember reading such messy lines.\nHuo Zheng chuckled and whispered in her ear seductively, \u201cSince the goddess thinks I\u2019ve sullied my divinity, if I sully the goddess\u2019 divinity, the goddess won\u2019t think that way anymore.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan jolted as though she had been electrocuted. Her ears were red as she tried to push Huo Zheng away and complained, \u201cWhy did you change your lines? Feng\u2026 Feng Xiaohan isn\u2019t a hooligan like you\u2026\u201d\nHuo Zheng laughed. \u201cCan\u2019t 1 even kiss you?\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s no kiss in the script!\u201d Lin Xiaowan said indignantly, \u201cHow dare you kiss the goddess! I\u2019m going to deduct your points! Moreover, Feng Xiaohe is a female character. Why are you reading her lines as though she\u2019s a man?\u201d\nHuo Zheng\u2019s expression did not change at all, and he continued to hold her in his arms. He said seriously, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m not good at acting, after all. Qingqing, you think too highly of me.\u201d\n\u201cNonsense! You clearly acted very well earlier.\u201d\nHuo Zheng\u2019s powerful and lazy aura when he read his lines earlier was even better than hers. However, it might also have something to do with his personality. He was usually high and mighty and domineering, used to giving orders at work.\nThinking about this, Lin Xiaowan had a flash of inspiration. She thought she could try to imitate Huo Zheng\u2019s cold and aloof image when working. She quickly expressed her thoughts to him.\nHuo Zheng nodded and asked, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you follow me to the company to observe how I work?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan pushed Huo Zheng away and said, \u201c1 decline.\u201d\nHuo Zheng was puzzled.\nLin Xiaowan ignored Huo Zheng. She grabbed the script that had been left at the side, humming a tune as she went upstairs.\n\nHuo Zheng laughed. He calmed down his restless heart before he read the news report.\nThe next day, Lin Xiaowan left in the same car as Huo Zheng.\nWhen they arrived at Huo Zheng\u2019s company, Huo Zheng got out of the car reluctantly. He knew that Lin Xiaowan was going to film her scenes for the first time today, and he wanted to watch her. He had mentioned it to her, but he was ruthlessly rejected. After getting out of the car, he still did not give up and asked, \u201c1 really can\u2019t take a look?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Lin Xiaowan said, not giving in. She pried his hand off the car door, chasing him away as she said, \u201cAlright, hurry up and go to work.\u201d\nHuo Zheng knew she probably felt shy and embarrassed so he could only give up, feeling regretful.\nOn the other hand, Lin Xiaowan, who was in the car, saw his aggrieved and helpless expression and could not help but feel a little guilty. She said, \u201cAfter I get my makeup done and change into my costume, I\u2019ll send you a photo.\u201d\nHuo Zheng was unaware of her thoughts, and he just nodded.\nWhile Lin Xiaowan was on the way to the set, she received a call from Qiao You\u2019an.\nQiao You\u2019an and Gu Yuwu kept in contact from time to time. As such, she knew that Lin Xiaowan had been going to the set so she called to ask about it.\n\u201cHow do you feel? Do you feel comfortable? Did anyone bully you?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan replied, \u201cNo, it\u2019s quite fun. 1 think acting is interesting.\u201d\nShe laughed and continued to say, \u201cPerhaps 1 find it interesting because the role isn\u2019t difficult. I just need to sit and say my lines.\u201d\n\u201cIf you find it interesting, you can ask Gu Yuwu to keep an eye out for suitable roles for you. Our family doesn\u2019t dabble in the entertainment industry. Gu Yuwu is a professional, and she has an entertainment company.\u201d\nCompared to acting, Lin Xiaowan felt like she was more interested in the murder mystery game that Chang Ning mentioned. According to Chang Ning, the game was a role-playing game. Everyone would be given a role, and it would only take a few hours to complete the game. It could satisfy one\u2019s interest without taking too much time.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no need for that,\u201d Lin Xiaowan replied before she asked, \u201cSister, have you ever played a murder mystery game?\u201d\nThis was the first time that Qiao You\u2019an had heard of this. She asked, \u201cNo. What is it?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a game where everyone is assigned a role, and the objective is to find the murderer. 1 haven\u2019t played it before either. Someone in the production told me about it,\u201d Lin Xiaowan said before she seized the opportunity and asked, \u201cShall we find time to play this game?\u201d\nIt was rare for Lin Xiaowan to suggest such a thing so Qiao You\u2019an did not refuse her. She said, \u201cThat sounds like a good idea. If you come across such a thing again in the future, we can play it together..\u201d\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

The entire process took more than four hours to complete. Her makeup was not very different from yesterday, but it took more time today to paint the golden incantation on her body.\nWhen filming finally started, Lin Xiaowan discovered that although her role had very few scenes, it would still take a long time to film a scene. In fact, this did not have much to do with her because she was just sitting and reciting her lines. However, the lead actors were different. They had to be filmed from different angles, and they had to repeat their lines over and over again, which took a lot of time.\nIn the end, the scene took half the afternoon to shoot.\nWhen Lin Xiaowan was filming the last shot, she raised her hand to her mouth and lowered her head before she yawned. After that, she looked around carefully, afraid of being discovered. Fortunately, everyone\u2019s attention was focused on the group of passionate and fierce protagonists.\nAfter so many takes, Lin Xiaowan was no longer as energetic as she was in the beginning. She propped her elbows on the side and said her lines coldly and nonchalantly before staring at the others.\nThe filming process was not as difficult as she had imagined, and she said her lines without any difficulties. However, in the beginning, her voice trembled slightly when she said her lines due to nervousness. She was not so good that she could pass with just one take. Nonetheless, Gu Yuwu and the director still praised her performance.\nApart from that, she also found that it was not as interesting as she had imagined. In the past, she had occasionally watched some behind-the-scenes videos and found them interesting. It was very common for actors to forget and say the wrong lines, and everyone would laugh about it. She had found it interesting at that time. However, now that she was experiencing it for herself, she found it different. It was not that it was not interesting, but after repeating it so many times, she grew bored.\n\nAt the same time, the director was watching everything from behind the cameras. He inevitably saw Lin Xiaowan secretly yawning and acting as though nothing happened, and he thought that it fitted the scene perfectly. He replayed it again and asked another person, \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d\n\u201cThe timing of her yawn is perfect. It shows her indifference to the common people and her boredom after living a long and lonely life. Moreover, this is a long shot. Microexpressions aren\u2019t really important. This small detail is just nice. It\u2019ll make people wonder why the seemingly indifferent goddess chose to help everyone in the end instead of destroying the world.\u201d\nThe director nodded in agreement. He said, \u201c1 feel like the character of the goddess will attract a lot of fans after the drama airs even though the goddess\u2019 scenes aren\u2019t a lot.\u201d\nThe goddess was a tragic character, to begin with. However, her selfishness and jealousy made her seem less tragic. However, the way Lin Xiaowan played the role seemed to give the aloof goddess a little more humanity, which made the character more likable.\nThe more the director watched, the more satisfied he felt. He said, \u201cThe casting for the goddess is really good. I was afraid that the character would only be seen as a villain and that people would forget about her origin\u2026\u201d\nThe director felt that there was no longer any need to worry about Lin Xiaowan\u2019s acting. Moreover, her voice would be dubbed over by a voice actor. There was really nothing that could be done about this. After all, although she looked and acted the part of the goddess, her soft voice did not match the character at all.\nWhen the filming of the scene ended, Lin Xiaowan quickly received her salary from the production team. Although she had generously transferred the money to Huo Zheng before this, she still wanted to give him something. After all, she rarely gave him anything. There were not many things that Huo Zheng needed, and she also had limited experience in giving gifts.\nShe was troubled by what to buy for Huo Zheng for a while, but she finally had an idea during one of her lessons with Xiao Han. She suddenly thought of painting something for Huo Zheng.\nShe thought about painting a lion dressed in a black suit and a tie, which was supposed to represent Huo Zheng, casually holding a bouquet of flowers. In her opinion, he was like a lion, the king of beasts. He was imposing and majestic in her eyes.\nHuo Zheng\u2019s birthday was in two months, and she felt that she would definitely be able to learn more by then from Xiao Han and Hong Minhua.\n\nMeanwhile, Xiao Han put down his brush and looked at the distracted Lin Xiaowan before he asked, \u201cJunior Sister, it seems like you have something on your mind today?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan returned to her senses. She smiled sheepishly when she realized that she had been caught distracted while in class. She said shyly, \u201cI was just wondering when I\u2019ll be able to start painting.\u201d\nSo far, Lin Xiaowan had only been learning how to sketch and shade. She had yet to use watercolors. She could not wait to fill her sketches with color, which would give her a sense of accomplishment and happiness. Initially, she had been very interested in her black-and-white sketches. However, as time passed, she grew bored and could not wait to move on.\nLin Xiaowan put the pencil in her hand down and relaxed her posture as she said, \u201cI want to learn how to paint\u2026\u201d\nShe found watercolors very beautiful.\nSeeing this, Xiao Han persuaded her patiently. \u201cJust practice the basics for two more days, okay? With a solid foundation, it\u2019ll be easier for you in the future\u2026\u201d\nLin Xiaowan felt rather unwilling. However, she did not reveal her true thoughts since she was not very familiar with Xiao Han. In the end, she was too embarrassed to say anything and could only continue drawing.\nIf Xiao Han were Huo Zheng in this situation, she would not have picked up her pencil. Instead, she would have gone over and persuaded Huo Zheng to let her paint. She would be able to do what she wanted to do instead of continuing to draw.\nPerhaps it was due to her restlessness and boredom, Lin Xiaowan\u2019s sketches became rather messy.\nXiao Han could only sigh helplessly when he saw her sketches. It was obvious that she was not very passionate about art. At most, she was just slightly interested. For someone like him who was passionate about art and was inexplicably obsessed with it, he should have felt angry about Lin Xiaowan\u2019s halfheartedness. However, when he watched her sketching unwillingly, he only felt helpless and thought that she was a little cute.\nXiao Han shook his head and dismissed the strange thoughts in his mind before he finally said, \u201cAlright, if you don\u2019t want to draw, we can end our lesson earlier today.\u201d\nUpon hearing these words, Lin Xiaowan stopped her movements. She did not put the pencil down, but she did not continue drawing either. Instead, she only looked at him with the pencil in her hand..\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

She asked tentatively, \u201c1 really don\u2019t have to draw anymore?\u201d\nAs soon as her voice fell, her phone began to ring. With this, she longer cared about what Xiao Han thought. She smiled flatteringly at him before she rose to her feet and went to the side to retrieve her phone. When she saw the caller, her smile bloomed like a flower on her face. Her boredom and listlessness from earlier seemed to vanish without a trace at this moment.\nShe had just been thinking earlier that she wanted Huo Zheng to try the noodles from the noodle restaurant. Previously, she thought about buying the noodles back for him, but she knew it would not taste good if she had ordered takeout. Even after the chef ar home reheated the noodles, they would nor taste the same.\nShe felt a little unsure when she told Huo Zheng about the noodles. After all, he was used to eating the best delicacies in the world. He might not be willing to accompany her to eat in such an ordinary restaurant. However, contrary to her expectations, as soon as she mentioned it to him, he agreed readily. He was also curious about the noodle restaurant she frequented during her lessons.\nEver since she ate at the noodle restaurant, she returned every time she had lessons. She was the kind to eat the things she liked over and over again until she had enough.\nLin Xiaowan knew that Huo Zheng was calling her because it was almost time to pick her up. She asked, \u201cAre you here? Or are you just leaving? There aren\u2019t many parking spaces near the restaurant. Why don\u2019t you park near rhe studio, and we\u2019ll walk there?\u201d\n\u201cOkay. I\u2019m only on my way now\u2026\u201d\nAfter a while, Lin Xiaowan returned to her seat happily.\nNow that Lin Xiaowan had ended the call, Xiao Han asked tentatively, \u201cBased on your phone call, it seems like you have plans after this?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan replied, \u201cYes. Do you want to join us for a meal? I\u2019ve told him about you so he knows all about you.\u201d\nAfter her first lesson, Lin Xiaowan had told Huo Zheng about her mistaking Xiao Han for a woman. He also told him that Xiao Han had graduated and was someone with a bright personality.\n\nXiao Han was slightly surprised when he heard her words. After a moment, he asked, \u201cIs he your friend or\u2026\u201d\n\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d Lin Xiaowan thought about it for a moment, biting the pencil before she said, \u201c1 guess you can say that he\u2019s my boyfriend.\u201d\nAlthough Lin Xiaowan told Huo Zheng to pursue her first, in front of others, she still gave him an identity. In any case, Huo Zheng did not have to know about it. Moreover, although he was pursuing her, the way they interacted did not change at all.\nThinking about this, Lin Xiaowan suddenly added, \u201cHowever, he\u2019s in the process of pursuing me. I can t let him know that I\u2019ve already acknowledged him as my boyfriend. Otherwise, he\u2019ll be complacent.\u201d\n\u201cI thought you were single,\u201d Xiao Han blurted out, surprised.\n\u201cAh?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan instinctively raised her hand to show him her ring as she said, \u2018Tm wearing a ring.\u201d\nShe did not understand why he would think she was single.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t notice,\u201d Xiao Han said awkwardly. After all, her ring was plain and ordinary. Many people wore rings so he assumed it was just an accessory.\nApart from surprise, there were some subtle feelings in Xiao Han\u2019s heart as well. It felt as though his bubble had burst after listening to her words.\nHuo Zheng arrived very quickly. He sent Lin Xiaowan a message when he was outside the studio.\nLin Xiaowan completely forgot about her lesson as soon as she learned that Huo Zheng had arrived. She happily packed her things as she asked, \u201cSenior Brother, do you want to eat with us? Let\u2019s go and have some noodles! \u201d\nXiao Han struggled for a few seconds. In the end, he could not suppress the curiosity in his heart. He really wanted to see what kind of person Lin Xiaowan1 s boyfriend was. He wanted to go, but he felt embarrassed. As such, he asked, \u201cYou\u2019re going to eat with your boyfriend\u2026 Is it really okay for me to join both of you?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan did not think too much of Xiao Han\u2019s words. She replied casually, \u201cWhy is it not okay? You\u2019re just joining us for a meal.\u201d\n\nAfter a moment, she added, \u201cWhen you meet him later, don\u2019t let him know 1 referred to him as my boyfriend. He\u2019s not done pursuing me yet. His surname is Huo. I think you should be about the same age as him. How old are you?\u201d\nXiao Han helped her carry her bag and replied, \u201cI\u2019m 26 years old this year.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan looked at him in surprise before she sized him up. \u201cI couldn\u2019t tell at all. You look quite young, like a university student. Huo Zheng is turning 27 soon. You don\u2019t look the same age at all. Has your birthday passed?\u201d\n\u201cYes, my birthday is in the first month of the lunar year,\u201d Xiao Han replied. After listening to Xiao Wan\u2019s description of Huo Zheng, he became even more curious.\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s pretty early,\u201d Lin Xiaowan said, bouncing down the stairs.\nWhen they emerged from the studio, Lin Xiaowan sprinted over and pounced on Huo Zheng who was waiting for her by the car, giving him a big hug. After that, she gave a brief introduction.\n\u201cThis is my senior brother, Xiao Han.\u201d\nAs soon as they appeared, Huo Zheng had already discreetly sized Xiao Han up. He smiled politely and extended his hand as he said, \u201cI\u2019m Huo Zheng.\u201d\nXiao Han smiled, revealing his canine tooth. He looked like a very bright and sunny boy as he said, \u201cI heard a lot about you from Junior Sister. She said that we re about the same age, but we don\u2019t look like it at all. I was very curious. However, I understand what she meant now. Mr. Huo looks promising and capable, unlike me. We re about the same age, but I\u2019ve still yet to make any achievements.\u201d\nHuo Zheng did not think much of these words and said perfunctorily, \u201cYou\u2019re overpraising me.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan did not like small talk the most. She knew it was necessary but she found it boring. She was worried the two would continue chatting here so she urged, \u201cCome on. Let s go and eat.\u201d\nOut of habit, Lin Xiaowan held Huo Zheng\u2019s hand and chattered on and on about how delicious the noodles were. She would also ask for his opinion every once in a while.\nThe lady boss of the noodle restaurant was already familiar with Lin Xiaowan. When she saw the latter, she greeted the latter in a familiar manner, \u201cYou\u2019re here early today.\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d LinXiaowan said with a nod. She looked at the menu and discovered two new spring dishes: the classic braised meat noodles and eggplant sauce noodles. Although she did not understand what the two new dishes had to do with spring, she was still very interested in trying them.\nThe lady boss asked, \u201cWhat do you want to ear today?\u201d Then, she glanced at Huo Zheng, who was standing next to Lin Xiaowan, before she asked, \u201cYou brought a new friend today?\u201d\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

During her first visit, she had ordered a large bowl and was unable to finish it. Ever since then, she only ordered small portions of the noodles.\nHuo Zheng glanced at her from the corners of his eyes and asked, \u201cCan you finish it?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan shook her head and said righteously, \u201cI can\u2019t, but you\u2019re going to help me.\u201d\nHuo Zheng laughed and did not refute her words. Instead, he seemed pleased by her words. He asked gently, \u201cThen, what else should 1 order? Do you have any suggestions?\u201d\n\u201cThe chicken mushroom soup noodles are the best! The soup is really delicious as well.\u201d\nHuo Zheng nodded and ordered as she had suggested.\nAfter the three of them sat down, Lin Xiaowan looked at the drinks before she looked at Huo Zheng and said hesitantly, \u201cI want a drink\u2026\u201d\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you say the soup is delicious? Why do you want a drink?\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re completely different!\u201d\n\u201cDo you always order these drinks when you eat here?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan blinked and smiled, attempting to cover up. Ever since she started her lessons, she would come here and eat every time. Not only that, but she would order all kinds of drinks as well. The milk tea and soda were very satisfying.\nXiao Han previously said that Lin Xiaowan would lose her teeth if she drank too many sweet drinks. However, this time, he put in a good word for her. He said, \u201cYoung women like drinking sweet drinks. It\u2019s okay to drink them once in a while.\u201d\nIt would have been fine if Xiao Han did not speak up, but Lin Xiaowan felt even guiltier after listening to Xiao Han\u2019s words. She usually ate with Xiao Han so he knew very well if she only drank sweet drinks occasionally or not.\nHuo Zheng looked at Xiao Han with a faint smile before he shifted his gaze to Lin Xiaowan and said, \u201cLet\u2019s not have any sweet drinks today. Why don\u2019t you accompany me to drink the chicken soup? You personally recommended it to me, after all.\u201d\n\nLin Xiaowan did not protest and nodded readily. \u201cAlright.\u201d\nMeanwhile, Xiao Han touched the tip of his nose awkwardly and did not say anything else.\nAfter lunch, Xiao Han finally showed mercy. He did not insist on Lin Xiaowan practicing the basic line strokes anymore and began to teach her how to draw the human body.\n\u201cCan\u2019t 1 use watercolor when 1 draw?\u201d Lin Xiaowan asked.\n\u201cNo, you have to draw first,\u201d Xiao Han replied.\nIn the end, Lin Xiaowan found drawing the human body much more interesting than sketching still life to practice her basic lines.\nAt the beginning of April, the production team had completed the filming in the studio, and they were prepared to film outside.\nGu Yuwu called Lin Xiaowan and asked if she wanted to go on vacation for two days.\nOver the past few days, Lin Xiaowan had been immersed in her lessons. She thought about Gu Yuwu\u2019s invitation for a moment before she finally decided not to disturb the latter. She said, \u201cYou\u2019re going to work, not play. I\u2019ll only be disturbing you if I tag along.\u201d\nGu Yuwu did not force her and said, \u201cAlright. Focus on your art lessons then. Let\u2019s meet up when I return.\u201d\n\u201cAlright.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan had been learning from Xiao Han for some time before Hong Minhua suddenly appeared at the studio one day. The fashionable old lady wore an elegant corduroy dress and paired it with a cardigan, carrying a silver leather bag.\nHong Minhua looked at Lin Xiaowan\u2019s recent works and said, \u201cThey\u2019re pretty good.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan was very modest. She was very aware of her ability after all. How could she dare to be arrogant in front of Hong Minhua? She replied, \u201cThey\u2019re okay. Brother Xiao Han taught me a lot, but I\u2019m a bit slow.\u201d\nHong Minhua knew that Lin Xiaowan had been drawing the human body based on the models in the studio. To make things more convenient, she said, \u201cXiaowan, why don\u2019t you attend the human anatomy class at Shengjing\u2019s Academy of Fine Arts?\u201d\n\u201cIsn\u2019t this a little too fast?\u201d Xiao Han asked.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so. She\u2019s learning this as a hobby so there\u2019s no need to be so meticulous about her learning process,\u201d Hong Minhua said. Then, she looked at Lin Xiaowan before she continued to say, \u201cYou\u2019ll have plenty of time to practice after you attend the class. What do you think?\u201d\n\nLin Xiaowan was confused. \u201cWhat\u2019s the human anatomy class for? Am I just drawing humans?\u201d\n\u201cYes. It\u2019s a compulsory class for art students. It\u2019s different from the studio where you\u2019re drawing based on mannequins. During the class, someone will come and model for you. You\u2019ll find a suitable angle at that time and draw what you see from that angle,\u201d Hong Minhua explained.\nLin Xiaowan felt that it was not difficult. Moreover, it sounded more interesting than listening to Xiao Han\u2019s teachings in the studio day after day. For this reason, she readily agreed. \u201cOkay. When should I start? Do I start immediately?\u201d\nAt this moment, Xiao Han said, looking troubled, \u201cBut I haven\u2019t taught Junior Sister the necessary basics for that. 1 haven\u2019t even explained anything about human anatomy classes to her.\u201d\n\u201cHuh? What explanation is needed for the class?\u201d Lin Xiaowan asked, perplexed.\nHong Minhua said, \u201cDuring the human anatomy classes, the model will be naked. Is this okay with you?\u201d\n\u201cHuh?!\u201d\nLin Xiaowan was undoubtedly shocked. When she returned, she looked up human anatomy classes, and just as Hong Minhua and Xiao Han had said, it was indeed a common thing.\nThis was the first time that Lin Xiaowan, an unofficial art student, heard about nude models. She called Hong Minhua and apologized for her reaction. After all, she could not conceal her shock at all when she first heard about it from Hong Minhua. After reading about it, she decided to call Hong Minhua and asked if she could still attend the class.\nHong Minhua was slightly surprised. She was also very pleased with Lin Xiaowan\u2019s decision. She said, \u201cAlright. Tomorrow\u2019s human anatomy class will start at 1.30 PM. You\u2019ve been to Shengjing\u2019s Academy of Fine Arts, right? I\u2019ll be at the academy tomorrow. Come find me first, and I\u2019ll bring you to the class. My office is at the end of the corridor near the studio where we first met.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan noted these things and said, \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll remember it.\u201d\n\u201cIf you can\u2019t find me, just call me, okay?\u201d Hong Minhua said.\n\u201cI understand. Good night, Grandma Hong!\u201d\nAfter ending the call, Lin Xiaowan looked for Huo Zheng to share this big news with him. She was both nervous and excited. Hong Minhua told her that there were not many students in the class and that she could seize the opportunity to make friends if she wanted to. Otherwise, she could just concentrate on the class. Hong Minhuai also told her that there was no need to feel pressured because there were senior students who would attend the class just to have a look so it was not unusual to have unfamiliar faces during the class.\nLin Xiaowan had already thought about it. She planned to arrive early tomorrow so she could find an inconspicuous corner to sit in. She felt a little excited thinking about what she was going to draw.\nHuo Zheng silently listened to Lin Xiaowan and only frowned slightly. He restrained himself and did not object to her decision or say words she might not like to hear. The human body was beautiful and a work of art. There was no need to be so narrow-minded.\nIn the end, he patted her head gently and said, \u201cAlright, remember to tell me all about your classes tomorrow.\u201d\n\u201cAlright,\u201d Lin Xiaowan said with a nod. Even if he did not say this, she would still share her experience with him when she returned..\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

When Hong Minhua saw her, she instinctively looked up at the clock on the wall. It was only half past twelve.\n\u201cYou\u2019re here. Have you eaten yet?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan carried her backpack. Her hair had grown a little longer, and she tied it into two low ponytails. She wore a brown sweater with oversized overalls paired with a pair of white sheepskin boots with bows. She also accessorized her outfit with a pair of pearl earrings. She looked like a good student, whom teachers loved.\nShe tugged at the straps of her backpack, standing upright as she replied, \u201cI\u2019ve already eaten earlier.\u201d\nWith that, Hong Minhua brought her to meet the teachers, and after greeting them, she led Lin Xiaowan to the classroom.\nA few easels were already set up in a few different positions. There were not many of them, which left plenty of empty space.\nHong Minhua told Lin Xiaowan that there was no fixed position and that she could simply choose a position.\nAs planned, Lin Xiaowan chose a corner to sit in.\nAfter Hong Minhua helped Lin Xiaowan set up everything, the latter sat on the bench and sent a message to Huo Zheng.\n[Lin Xiaowan: There\u2019s no one in the classroom yet. I\u2019m ready! 1 feel nervous and excited!]\n[Lin Xiaowan: What should I say if another student greets me? Can 1 just say I\u2019m a student from another department coming to have a look?]\n[Lin Xiaowan: Today\u2019s class is for second-year students. They must be very good at drawing. I\u2019ve only begun learning, and I\u2019m not very good at drawing.] [Lin Xiaowan: Wow! A student just came in! She\u2019s a girl!]\n\nLin Xiaowan did not have anything to do now. She did not play any games or read her novels. Feeling uneasy, she sent a few messages to Huo Zheng.\nHuo Zheng\u2019s meeting lasted until noon. After lunch, the meeting continued. While the person in charge was talking, his phone rang a few times. He muted his phone, but he could not help but have a look at the messages.\nThe corners of his lips curled up as he read the messages, surprising many people who were sitting around the conference table.\nThe female student who just entered was chewing bubblegum and talking on the phone. When she saw an unfamiliar face in the classroom, she was slightly surprised. She stopped talking and paused in her steps before she retreated outside to confirm she was in the right place. Then, she ended the call and switched to messages instead.\nThe clicking noises rang in the air, and Lin Xiaowan found the sound rather pleasant to hear.\nThe female student looked at the class schedule and the group message with an uncertain expression on her face. After confirming that she was truly at the right place, she sighed in relief. At the same time, she complained to her classmates, saying that she would not come so early the next time. She thought she had entered the wrong classroom due to the unfamiliar face.\nLin Xiaowan was initially very nervous. However, after being ignored, not only was she not disappointed, but she even felt relieved. She preferred being ignored.\nWhen the class was about to start, more and more people entered the classroom. They greeted each other. Some of them chatted while some of them played with their phones.\nLin Xiaowan hid behind the easel. When people looked at her, they would smile amiably, and she would also return the smile. After that, they would look away first. For some reason, she felt more at ease when this happened.\nIn fact, she had noticed this when she was on set. Many people were usually more nervous than her when they looked at her. Perhaps, this was the reason she was not very afraid. Moreover, Gu Yuwu told her before that most people were just curious and did not have ill intentions. As such, there was no need for her to panic.\nAt this moment, she did not panic, and she felt like she was very brave.\nSoon enough, the teacher and the model arrived.\nLin Xiaowan looked at the teacher attentively, and the teacher even wondered if something was wrong. However, in the next moment, she lost all of her courage when the teacher instructed the model to remove her clothes and instruct the students to start drawing.\nThe model was a fifty-one-year-old middle-aged woman. Her skin was sallow, and she was thin, looking a little malnourished. There were many wrinkles on her forehead and the corners of her eyes. Her ribs were also very distinct, and she had a long scar on her stomach. She was very calm, and it was clear that this was not the first time she was doing this. She was very relaxed and calmly got into a comfortable position with a slight smile on her face.\nThe moment the model removed her clothes, Lin Xiaowan\u2019s face heated up. She lowered her head and pretended to focus on the drawing paper. When she looked up again, she did not dare to look at the model directly. Instead, she looked around and discovered that she was the only one who felt uncomfortable. A boy sitting not far from her had already begun to draw.\n\nIt was very quiet now. There was no sound of laughing or conversation. Everyone was seriously drawing.\nLin Xiaowan gradually calmed down. She raised her pencil, feeling a little helpless. She took a few deep breaths to calm down again as she told herself inwardly, \u2018There\u2019s nothing to feel embarrassed about. The model, the students, and the teacher aren\u2019t embarrassed so why should I feel embarrassed? Be brave, be brave!\u2019\nThe position Lin Xiaowan had chosen was not bad. Although it was in a corner, she still had a direct view of the model. She could see the model very clearly.\nLin Xiaowan mentally prepared herself for a very long time before she began to think about how to draw. As time passed, she gradually became immersed in drawing. When she looked up again, she no longer looked as uncomfortable as before. She was focused on thinking about the perspective and drawing.\nThe teacher observed Lin Xiaowan from time to time and even took the time to send a message to Hong Minhua.\n[The teacher: Although it\u2019s her first time attending this class, her performance is not bad.]\nHong Minima\u2019s reply came swiftly.\n[Hong Minhua: I\u2019m not surprised. I\u2019m confident about my ability to judge people after all.]\nLin Xiaowan did not need to hand in her work to the teacher. Instead, she only needed to show it to Hong Minhua. Even then, the teacher gave her a lot of advice.\nWhen Lin Xiaowan saw the other students\u2019 words, she could not help but exclaim, \u201cWow!\u201d\nShe had thought her own drawing was quite good earlier. However, now that she had seen the other students\u2019 works, she realized that her drawing was truly terrible. In a daze, she said bluntly, \u201cMy drawing is terrible.\u201d\nThe teacher seemed to disagree and said seriously, \u201cTeacher Hong told me that you only learned how to draw recently. Considering that, you\u2019re already very good. Don\u2019t belittle yourself. Look, the way you handle the shadow here is very good. As a whole, your drawing is very good. It\u2019s okay to admire others, but don\u2019t belittle yourself, okay? Admire yourself more.\u201d\nAlthough the teacher\u2019s voice was not gentle and was even a little harsh, her words seemed to have a magical effect on Lin Xiaowan.\nShe felt like she had learned a lesson again.\n\u2018That\u2019s right.. It\u2019s okay to admire myself more\u2026\u2019\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

She only explained things to her in detail and gave her homework.\nSince Hong Minhua did not need Lin Xiaowan\u2019s sketch, Lin Xiaowan asked if she could bring her sketch back.\nHuo Zheng listened attentively as she spoke. After she carefully unrolled her sketch as though it was a treasure, he said, praising her sincerely, \u201cIt looks great. Your drawing is really good, little painter.\u201d\nAlthough his words were few, his expression and his tone were sincere.\nLin Xiaowan was very satisfied and did not quibble with him.\nSince she did not have to attend class at Shengjing\u2019s Academy of Fine Arts every day, she could still go for lessons at Unnamed Studio with Xiao Han.\nHong Minhua originally intended to let Lin Xiaowan follow so Lin Xiaowan would not trouble Xiao Han. Moreover, Xiao Han was going to participate in a competition and would soon be busy. It would be troublesome if he also had to teach Lin Xiaowan.\nHowever, Xiao Han did not think much of it and even specially told Hong Minhua to let Lin Xiaowan continue learning at Unnamed.\nLin Xiaowan chatted with Huo Zheng every day about the smallest things so Huo Zheng was naturally aware of this matter as well. While she chatted with him, she worked on the homework that Hong Minhua gave her. She sat in front of an easel not far from the desk in the study while he sat at the desk to work.\nAfter a while, Huo Zheng stopped working and said, \u201cActually, we can build a studio for you at home.\u201d\nTheir house was large enough, and they had a few empty rooms. Apart from the bedroom, there were also guestrooms and the nanny\u2019s room. They also had a home theatre and a gym. There was also a storage room where Lin Xiaowan kept the models she built and various toys.\nCurrently, they had two unused rooms. Of the two, one had large windows and a balcony, allowing sunlight to stream in. There was not much furniture in the room as well. All in all, it was suitable to be converted into a studio.\n\n\u201cThat sounds like a good idea\u2026\u201d Lin Xiaowan replied after thinking about it for a moment.\n\u201cWith that, you also don\u2019t have to trouble others. You can tell the driver to send Teacher Hong here,\u201d Huo Zheng said.\nLin Xiaowan followed Hong Minhua for classes twice a week, and they would usually use an empty studio in Shengjing\u2019s Academy of Fine Arts. Apart from that, she also did not need to go to Unnamed. It was indeed more convenient to have a studio at home.\nWith a studio, she did not need to wake up early. She could sleep in until 9 AM. and after having breakfast with Huo Zheng, she would go to the studio while he went to work.\nHowever, the disadvantage was that she could no longer eat and drink whatever she wanted for lunch. The chef was carefully selected by Huo Zheng, and he was very particular about nutrition.\nLin Xiaowan had just gone for a checkup two days ago. There was no serious problem with her health. She was just a little thin and slightly anemic. All in all, she was in quite good health after recuperating, which meant that she did not have to be too restrained when it came to her food.\nFortunately, most of the time she only needed to act coquettishly with Huo Zheng before he gave in and allowed her to eat whatever she wanted.\nAt this time, Lin Xiaowan nodded seriously and said, \u201cI think your suggestion is very good. Then, how should we turn the room into a studio?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll arrange it,\u201d Huo Zheng said, standing up to get her a glass of water.\nLin Xiaowan did not think much of it. When he was around, he would always urge her to drink more water.\n\u201cWhat are you painting today?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan showed him her painting.\nAlthough she was not very good, and the colors looked messy, Huo Zheng still praised her very seriously. He had taken art classes when he was young as well, dabbling in many many things. Unlike Hong Minhua who would point out her mistakes and advise her, he would ignore the flaws of her work and only praised her. He did not use any fancy words and alternated between \u2018good\u2019, \u2018it looks great, and \u2018awesome\u2019.\nLin Xiaowan decided to stop painting for now. After washing her brushes, she asked, \u201cHow long will it take to set up the studio? It won\u2019t be so fast, right? In that case, I\u2019ll go to Unnamed tomorrow.\u201d\nShe looked at Huo Zheng and continued to ask, \u201cShould I get a gift for Senior Brother Xiao Han? After all, I\u2019ve troubled him for so long.\u201d\nHuo Zheng nodded as he helped her to clean up her art supplies.\n\n\u201cWhat should I get him?\u201d Lin Xiaowan asked, \u201cArt supplies? Lighter? However, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen him smoking\u2026\u201d\nFeeling a little jealous, Huo Zheng asked, \u201cWhy weren\u2019t you this meticulous when getting gifts for me?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan giggled. \u201cAlright. When I buy him a gift, why don\u2019t I get you a gift as well since it\u2019s convenient.\u201d\n\u201cBecause it\u2019s convenient?\u201d Huo Zheng raised an eyebrow, and his gaze turned dangerous.\nLin Xiaowan quickly changed her words. \u201cWhen I buy you a gift, I\u2019ll conveniently buy him a gift as well?\u201d\nHuo Zheng replied reluctantly, \u201cThat sounds better.\u201d\nIn the end, Lin Xiaowan bought a set of watercolors for Xiao Han. Thanks to the shop owner\u2019s recommendation, she also bought a movable mannequin for herself.\nAs for Huo Zheng, Lin Xiaowan played it safe and bought him a pair of sneakers from Louis Vuitton. She also bought a pair of matching ones. She put quite a lot of thought into picking out the pair of shoes. It was simple, and it was black and white. In her opinion, it would be easy to match the shoes. After a moment, she even thought she could help him pick his clothes to match the shoes.\nWhen Huo Zheng returned, she saw two pairs of matching sneakers at the entrance. One of them was clearly not in Lin Xiaowan\u2019s size. He did not think too much of it and asked, \u201cYou bought him a pair of shoes?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan rolled her eyes and said, \u201cHow would I know the size of his feet? Moreover, if I bought it for him, why would I display it at the entrance?\u201d Realization dawned on Huo Zheng immediately. \u201cCouple\u2019s shoes?\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s right. What do you think of the shoes?\u201d Lin Xiaowan asked, \u201cDo you want to try them?\u201d\nHuo Zheng tried on the sneakers, which contrasted greatly with his black suit and tie. The sneakers were made of leather, and they were very comfortable. After trying them on, he said with a smile, \u201cI usually wear sneakers when I work out.\u201d\nThere were sneakers in the cabinet at the entrance of the gym at home, and he only wore them working out. It had been years since he had worn them out. Due to work, he was usually dressed rather formally. As time passed, he gradually got used to wearing suits and leather suits all the time. Even the designers would send him similar things every season.\nLin Xiaowan said, \u201cHow can you wear this to work out? By the way, the style and colors of your clothes in the wardrobe are too monotonous.\u201d\nShe reached to pinch his cheek before she continued to say, \u201cYou\u2019re only 27 years old, but you dress like you\u2019re 37. Even your eldest brother looks younger than you.\u201d\nHuo Zheng was silent for a moment, trying to recall the times he was with Huo Cheng.\n\u2018Is Brother dressed very young? I don\u2019t think so, right? With his job, he\u2019s dressed even more formally than me\u2026\u2019\nAfter a moment, Huo Zheng\u2019s thoughts drifted to Lin Xiaowan\u2019s young and energetic senior brother, and he could help but feel displeased. He thought that if Lin Xiaowan liked it, he did not mind changing the way he dressed..\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

She only gave him the gift and expressed her gratitude.\n\u201cYou\u2019re too polite. There\u2019s no need for this.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan naturally insisted that he accept the gift. She said, \u201cNo, 1 feel extremely sorry for troubling you for so long. Moreover, I bought this for you. I don\u2019t have any use for it.\u201d\nWith this, Xiao Han finally accepted the gift. After that, he told her that she could look for him if she ever needed help.\nLin Xiaowan thought he was only being courteous because of the gift so she only nodded perfunctorily.\nIt was not difficult to set up a studio at all. In just two days, Huo Zheng told Lin Xiaowan she could use the studio. He also prepared all kinds of drawing paper and canvases for her and installed professional lighting.\nThe easel had been moved to the studio. There was a small desk at the side, and a daybed near the window so she could rest. There was also a shelf filled with all kinds of art-related books.\nLin Xiaowan was quite satisfied with how it turned out.\nAfter the studio was completed, the driver would pick Hong Minhua up two days a week. When she came over and saw the studio, she nodded in approval.\nHuo Zheng decided to take a day off and go shopping with Lin Xiaowan. Initially, he planned to ask his assistant to make arrangements and get designers to send the clothes to the house. However, Lin Xiaowan thought that was boring so she pestered him and asked him to go shopping with her.\nHuo Zheng naturally did not refuse her, especially when he saw how much she wanted it. Moreover, it had indeed been a very long time since they had gone shopping together. However, it was completely beyond his expectations that his sister-in-law, Qiao You\u2019an, would also join them.\nWhen Qiao You\u2019an learned from Lin Xiaowan that Huo Zheng wanted to change the way he dressed, she was very excited and decided to join in the fun.\n\nWhen he saw Qiao You\u2019an at the entrance of Burberry, he could not help but stiffen.\n\u201cSister-in-law.\u201d\nQiao You\u2019an came alone since her two sons had to go to school. However, when the two children heard she was going shopping without them, they were naturally unhappy.\nLin Xiaowan let go of Huo Zheng\u2019s hand and happily ran to Qiao You\u2019an\u2019s side, holding Qiao You\u2019an\u2019s arm.\nHuo Zheng walked behind them, looking like an aloof bodyguard.\nAlthough Lin Xiaowan went shopping often, she still found it difficult to adapt to the shopping experience in a luxury store. Instead of trying on the clothes, they picked out the clothes they liked before models would model the clothes for them.\nHuo Zheng stood next to the two women and acted like a human pillar. He allowed Lin Xiaowan to select all kinds of clothes and measure them against him. If they liked it, the sales assistant would note it down and let the model change into the clothes.\nQiao You\u2019an casually picked out a baseball cap, thinking that it would suit Huo Cheng. When she saw how enthusiastic Lin Xiaowan was, she said teasingly, \u201cPreviously, you weren\u2019t so enthusiastic when I invited you out shopping. Look at how enthusiastic you are now that you\u2019re shopping for Huo Zheng.\u201d\nPreviously, Lin Xiaowan had casually downloaded a game of dress-up on her phone. She did not think too much of it and felt that it was good to kill time. However, today, she really felt the fun of playing dress-up.\nApart from Burberry, they also went to many other stores.\nIn the end, Qiao You\u2019an teased Lin Xiaowan again. \u201cWow, Xiaowan, you complained after walking a few steps when we went shopping. However, you don\u2019t seem tired even after walking 10,000 steps today, huh?\u201d\nIn fact, this was normal. This was the difference between doing something one was interested in and something one had no interest in. One would have no patience at all when doing something one was not interested in. On the contrary, no matter how hard it was, one would enjoy it if one was interested.\n\u201cLet\u2019s see if you still dare to act like the next time you come out with me,\u201d Qiao You\u2019an warned jokingly.\nLin Xiaowan smiled sheepishly and said, \u201cI don\u2019t dare, 1 don\u2019t dare!\u201d\nWhen they were home, Lin Xiaowan made Huo Zheng try on the clothes.\nThe 1.9-meter-tall man felt slightly uncomfortable when he put on his new clothes. He was wearing a black T-shirt, a dark brown vintage jacket, black pants, and a pair of brown boots, revealing his wide shoulders and long legs. Just a casual glance was enough to attract people\u2019s attention.\n\nLin Xiaowan\u2019s eyes lit up when she saw him. She clapped her hands and exclaimed, \u201cYou\u2019re so handsome!\u201d\nLin Xiaowan circled him, studying him. She thought he looked fresh. The way he was dressed made him look gentler, and his aura softened a lot as well.\nLin Xiaowan kept praising him. They had shopped for half a day, and it seemed like it was all worth it. She quickly instructed him to change into the other clothes so she could have a look. She had bought shirts and sweaters in different colors such as dove grey, white, and yellow-and-blue. She also bought casual khaki pants for him.\nAs time passed, Huo Zheng no longer felt uncomfortable. He began to feel as though he was back in school. After all, when he was in school, he did not have to dress rigidly. His habit of dressing formally only started when his parents passed away in his third year of university and he had to take over Huo Corporation.\nEvery time Huo Zheng changed into a new set of clothes, Lin Xiaowan would take a photo and send it to the Huo family\u2019s group chat so Huo Cheng and Qiao You\u2019an could have a look.\nHuo Dabao and Huo Erbao were also in the group chat, but they were not good at typing. As such, they would usually send voice messages or call directly. The two children were not very interested in what Huo Zheng was wearing. Instead, they were more interested in asking when they could play with Lin Xiaowan.\nLin Xiaowan\u2019s excitement lasted until she went to bed at night. She praised him again, \u201cYou\u2019re like a walking clothes rack. You look handsome no matter what you wear. Don\u2019t just wear suits all the time.\u201d\nHuo Zheng asked, \u201cSince I\u2019m so handsome, can 1 be Miss Lin\u2019s boyfriend?\u201d\n\u201cAh?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan was briefly stunned.\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t agreed yet.\u201d\nOnly then did realization dawn on Lin Xiaowan. Previously, she had told him to pursue her when she was in the hospital. She also told him to confess to her again.\nLin Xiaowan laughed before saying arrogantly, \u201cThat\u2019ll depend on Mr. Huo\u2019s performance.\u201d\nHuo Zheng stared at her for a moment before he lowered his head to kiss and asked, \u201cWhat do you think of this performance?\u201d\nWhen he spoke, his lips were very close to Lin Xiaowan\u2019s ears. She felt that his magnetic voice seemed capable of bewitching people. She quickly shrank back and pushed him away as she said, \u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant!\u201d\nThen, Lin Xiaowan continued to say, \u201cYou\u2019re being a hooligan now!\u201d\n\u201cWhat if 1 insist on being a hooligan?\u201d Huo Zheng asked with a chuckle.\nLin Xiaowan pretended to look troubled before she finally said, \u201cThen I guess I can only let you be Miss Lin\u2019s boyfriend. That way, you won\u2019t be a hooligan.\u201d Huo Zheng\u2019s smile widened immediately. He felt that the woman in his arms was really cute..\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

Do you like it that much?\u201d\nIn her opinion, it did not matter if he liked to dress formally. It would be good enough for him to dress in a casual manner occasionally when he went out with her.\nIn fact, Huo Zheng did not have much of a preference when it came to clothes, especially when he was younger. Most of his clothes were already matched before they were hung in his wardrobe. The clothes were sent to him by designers, and he did not personally choose them. Moreover, dressing formally was more of a necessity because of work.\nHuo Zheng replied lightly, \u201cI dress formally for work\u2026\u201d\nLin Xiaowan looked at him quietly for a moment before she suddenly asked,\n\u201cCan I ask you how your parents passed away?\u201d\nHowever, immediately after asking this question, she was worried that it would make him sad so she quickly added, \u201cIt\u2019s fine you don\u2019t want to talk about it! The question just suddenly appeared in my mind!\u201d\nLin Xiaowan only knew that he had taken over Huo Corporation in a hurry after his parents passed away. He had yet to graduate from university at that time, and he had to devote himself to the company. He never knew the reason for his parents\u2019 death.\nHuo Zheng stroked her hair and said, \u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d\nApart from a hint of sadness, there was also admiration for his parents and their relationship when he thought about them.\n\n\u201cMy mother\u2019s health had always been poor. She was also a lot older than my father. In the end, she died of illness. After her death, my father resigned and let me manage the affairs of the company. Since I had already been learning to manage the company, it didn\u2019t take a lot to get used to it. I also knew the shareholders. Apart from that, my father also taught me a lot so it did not take long for me to completely familiarize myself with the company.\n\u201cHow old were you at that time?\u201d Lin Xiaowan asked.\n\u201cI was in my third year in university.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan nodded and continued to listen attentively. She thought Huo Zheng\u2019s parents had died at the same time. As it turned out, that was not the case.\nAfter checking that Lin Xiaowan was fine, Huo Zheng continued to say, \u201cA year later, on the anniversary of my mother\u2019s death, my father took his life. He arranged everything and left a will behind.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan exclaimed softly, surprised by the sudden turn of the story. Then, she reached out to hug Huo Zheng and gently patted his pack, clumsily comforting him in her own way.\nHuo Zheng smiled and kissed the top of her forehead before he said, \u201cIt\u2019s fine. Outsiders were blindsided by it, but my brother and I weren\u2019t extremely surprised. He left a short letter for us, telling us not to be sad because he went to look for the person he loved.\u201d\nHuo Zheng rarely reminisced about the past. After all, the past could not be changed. What was the point of reminiscing about the past? However, at this moment, he could not help but think about the first year after his mother\u2019s death.\nHis mother\u2019s death was not unexpected because she had been ill for a long time. Therefore, although he and Huo Cheng were sad, they managed to come to terms with her death.\nHowever, it was different with his father. His father seemed to age greatly and rapidly after his mother passed away. His father would not allow anyone else to clean their bedroom or touch and move the things in their bedroom. It was as though he was trying to forcefully stop time in the bedroom.\nHuo Zheng accidentally came across a letter from his father to his mother by chance later on. His father had earnestly asked his mother to wait for him, hoping to reunite with her in death. His father had loved his mother too much.\nEver since the room was converted into a studio and Hong Minhua came over to teach her, Lin Xiaowan had nothing else to do. Just like that, she became a shut-in again.\nThere was a housekeeper to clean the house, and a chef to cook their meals. With this, she really had nothing to do.\n\nEven Aunt Wu, the nanny, felt like Lin Xiaowan was too much of a homebody. Usually, she would go square dancing at night. In the morning, she would go to a small park nearby to practice Tai Chi with other elderly people.\nThis morning, when Aunt Wu saw Lin Xiaowan yawning after breakfast, she advised Lin Xiaowan to go for a walk.\n\u201cIt\u2019s neither hot nor cold now; the weather is good. Why don\u2019t you go for a walk, Miss Lin? It\u2019s good for your health to bask in the sun. It\u2019ll help with your bone maintenance.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan rubbed her stomach, completely uninterested. She felt that lying down after eating was the happiest thing in the world. She said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to move\u2026 Moreover, I did bask in the sun.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan liked to sleep by the bay window in the afternoon. She would wear her eye mask and hug her life-size plushie to sleep. The noon sun made her feel warm and cozy.\nAunt Wu laughed. \u201cYou look like a kitten when you do that.\u201d\nAfter Aunt Wu swept the floor and watered the plants, she walked around the house and confirmed that there was nothing else that needed to be done. After that, she changed her shoes, preparing to go out. She asked, \u201cI\u2019m going to the supermarket. Miss Lin, do you want to come with me?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan quickly got up. She had not had any snacks lately so it was time to go shopping. She hurriedly said, \u201cOf course! Let\u2019s go to the baking shop!\u201d\nLin Xiaowan quickly went and changed. When she came downstairs, Aunt Wu asked, \u201cMiss Lin, is there anything you want to buy from the baking shop?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan recently went to the website Gu Yuwu had shown her previously. She had set baking as her preference so she was shown many videos of Eastern and Western desserts. She even saved the videos in a playlist and named it, \u2018I Can Do It If I Put My Mind to It\u2019.\n\u201cI want to buy some supplies. I want to try baking,\u201d Lin Xiaowan said.\nWhen Aunt Wu came for the interview, she had brought her certificate with her. She was a certified traditional pastry chef in Shangxia. When she was working in the kindergarten, she was responsible for making desserts for the children.\n\u201cAunt Wu, you have experience so you must help me,\u201d Lin Xiaowan said.\nAunt Wu was naturally happy to show off her skills and readily agreed.\n\u201cOf course!\u201d\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

When the chef came over to make lunch, she took a few bags of chips and went to the studio.\nAfter lunch, she did not take a nap. Instead, she practiced sketching for a while before she remembered the baking supplies she bought earlier.\nIn the kitchen.\nLin Xiaowan decided to make a no-baking Oreo cake.\nAunt Wu only knew how to make traditional pastries. This was also her first time trying to make a Western cake. After watching the tutorial video, she also felt that it was very simple. With this, she felt reassured and helped Lin Xiaowan.\nEven without experience with Western pastries, Aunt Wu was still experienced after all. She would occasionally give Lin Xiaowan advice and teach the latter how to measure the ingredients.\n\nIn the end, the cake turned out quite good in both appearance and taste.\n\u201cIs this really your first time?\u201d Aunt Wu asked, slightly surprised.\nLin Xiaowan picked an angle and took a photo, filled with a sense of accomplishment. Then, she began to praise herself. \u201cDon\u2019t you think I\u2019m quite talented?\u201d\n\u201cIndeed, you\u2019re very talented, Miss Lin,\u201d Aunt Wu said.\nThe mold Lin Xiaowan bought was not big so the cake was about five inches in size.\nAfter Lin Xiaowan ate half of it, Aunt Wu put it in the refrigerator and said, \u201cLet\u2019s eat it tomorrow. If you eat too much, you won\u2019t be able to eat dinner.\u201d\nIn the evening.\nLin Xiaowan took a photo and sent it to Huo Zheng, but the latter was probably busy so he did not reply. Lin Xiaowan said to Aunt Wu, \u201cTake the cake out for Huo Zheng to try after dinner.\u201d\nHowever, Lin Xiaowan was very excited, and in the end, she brought the cake out herself.\n\u201cI\u2019ll bring it out first. He can have a taste when he comes back.\u201d\n\nHuo Zheng only saw Lin Xiaowan\u2019s message when he got off work. After replying to her, he did not receive a reply from her. When he got home, he saw half a cake on the dining table. There was even a small conspicuous bite at the corner. He was a little puzzled. He saw Aunt Wu and the chef cooking in the kitchen, but he did not see Lin Xiaowan. He thought that she must be holed up in the studio or the storage room.\n\u201cMr. Huo, you\u2019re back,\u201d Aunt Wu greeted Huo Zheng.\nHuo Zheng nodded and headed upstairs.\nAt the same time, Aunt Wu called out, \u201cMr. Huo, Mr. Huo!\u201d\nHuo Zheng turned around and looked at Aunt Wu expressionlessly, indicating for her to speak.\nAunt Wu hurried over, bringing the cake over on a porcelain plate with a fork lying at the side. The little fork still had remnants and Oreos and cream cheese on it. She said, \u201cMiss Lin made this cake today. She ate half of it and left the other half for you. She was so excited so she brought it out earlier. However, after a while, she took a bite. In the end, this is all that\u2019s left. If you came back a little later, Miss Lin would\u2019ve eaten this last bite. Mr. Huo, hurry up and try it.\u201d\nHuo Zheng did not expect Lin Xiaowan to make the cake herself. When she sent him the photo, she did not say much. He thought that she was just telling him that she had cake today.\nHuo Zheng nodded before he asked, \u201cIs she upstairs?\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s in the studio trying to draw, but she\u2019s very distracted. It\u2019s as though her soul has been seduced by the cake. She\u2019d come down every few minutes,\u201d Aunt Wu replied.\nHuo Zheng could not help but smile. Then, he used the fork that Lin Xiaowan used and ate the last bite of the cake. As soon as the cake entered his mouth, he paused briefly. However, his expression did not change at all as he put the small fork back on the plate. It was a little too sweet for him. It seemed like Lin Xiaowan had used quite a bit of sugar.\nHowever, he knew that Lin Xiaowan had a sweet tooth. Hence, this amount of sugar was just nice for her.\nAfter that, Huo Zheng went to look for her at the studio..\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

She would go to the kitchen every day; her desire to bake was out of control. Apart from cakes, she would also make bread, biscuits, and other pastries. However, it was not a success every time. For example, she failed many times when trying to bake the most basic chiffon cake. However, this did not affect her passion for baking. She would still eat the failed product happily. If it was a success, she would even send them to Qiao You\u2019an.\nHuo Dabao and Huo Erbao were naturally delighted. They were little gluttons, after all. When they came home from school, their mouths would water when they saw the pastries that Lin Xiaowan sent over. After that, they would flatter her in the group chat.\nThe two children got along with Lin Xiaowan very well because they shared similar hobbies such as watching cartoons and eating snacks. Moreover, perhaps Lin Xiaowan was a little slow, the two children, who were much more mature than ordinary kids, loved the feeling of being admired and respected when they were with her. For all these reasons, they really liked her.\nOn this day, Hong Minhua arrived a little late due to her research. As soon as she entered the house, she could smell the fragrance in the air. She felt as though she had walked into a bakery. She asked curiously, \u201cIs she making something again today?\u201d\nAunt Wu brought the guest slippers out for Hong Minhua as she replied, \u201cYes, Teacher Hong. She made bread rolls today. You came just in time. Come in and have a taste.\u201d\n\nAunt Wu followed Lin Xiaowan\u2019s example and addressed Hong Minhua as \u2018Teacher Hong\u2019 as well.\nAfter changing her shoes, Aunt Hong put her small bag down and said, \u201cI\u2019m going to join the fun.\u201d\nIn the kitchen.\nApart from meat floss bread rolls, Lin Xiaowan made mango layer cake as well. At this moment, she was carefully holding a palm-sized bread roll in her hands that were clad in disposable gloves. She applied a layer of salad dressing on the sides of the bread roll before she filled it with a lot of meat floss.\nOn the plate next to her, there were already quite a few finished products.\nWhen Lin Xiaowan saw Hong Minhua, she was surprised since she did not hear the doorbell ring. She quickly called out, \u201cTeacher Hong, you\u2019re here! Come and have a taste of the bread rolls I made today!\u201d\nHong Minhua said with a hint of disapproval, \u201cDid you forget again? You can call me Teacher when we\u2019re in class. However, when we\u2019re not in class, you should call me Grandma Hong.\u201d\n\u201cGrandma Hong,\u201d Lin Xiaowan called out obediently.\n\nHong Minhua had tasted the food Lin Xiaowan made a few times now so she did not stand on ceremony. She took a small plate and spoon from the side over.\nThe bread rolls were still warm. They were soft, moist, and very fragrant. The dressing was generous, and the sweetness of the dressing complemented the saltiness of the meat floss very well.\nLin Xiaowan looked at Hong Minhua expectantly. She had done her best today. She felt that the bread rolls she made today were especially tasty.\nHong Minhua gave Lin Xiaowan a thumbs-up. Her smile was very wide as she said, \u201cIt\u2019s delicious! I\u2019m not exaggerating, but I think you can even sell them!\u201d Upon hearing this, Lin Xiaowan could not wait for Huo Zheng to get off work so he could try it. It was not enough to send a photo. In the end, she decided to pack the bread roll in a takeaway box and send it over to him. She also did not forget about Qiao You\u2019an. In fact, she gave Qiao You\u2019an even more bread rolls. Her takeaway boxes were all newly bought. After she folded them and stuck a small sticker on them, they really looked like the ones in dessert shops.\n\u201cYou\u2019re quite well prepared. Do you want to open up a dessert shop?,\u201d Hong Minhua commented casually.\nLin Xiaowan really wanted a dessert shop of her own. It did not have to be very big. What was important to her was the display. This was because the thought of filling the display with all kinds of cakes and bread made her happy. She could imagine standing in front of the display as the scent of the pastries permeated the air.\nHong Minhua was very observant. When she saw the expression on Lin Xiaowan\u2019s face, she suddenly felt the bread roll meat floss was not as fragrant as before. She asked, \u201cWhat? Did I really hit the nail on the head? Do you really intend to open up a dessert shop?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan giggled.\nHong Minhua looked at Lin Xiaowan with a helpless expression, She reached out and tapped Lin Xiaowan\u2019s forehead. She grumbled a little but she could not hide her affection as she said, \u201cYou\u2019re lucky Mr. Huo had already spoken to me in the beginning and told me that you\u2019re only learning art as a hobby. Otherwise, I would\u2019ve hit your palm, you fickle-minded fellow.\u201d\nHong Minhua was naturally just joking. The pair of hands that learned to draw were so precious.. How could she hit Lin Xiaowan\u2019s hands?\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

Hong Minhua did not put on air at all even though she was a big shot in the industry. For this reason, she was much more relaxed when getting along with Hong Minhua.\nLin Xiaowan pouted and said, \u201cI\u2019m sure you won\u2019t be willing to do that, Grandma Hong.\u201d\n\u201cGrandma Hong might not be willing, but Teacher Hong might,\u201d Hong Minhua said jokingly with a laugh. Despite her words, it was just as Lin Xiaowan said; she was definitely not willing to do it. After all, in her eyes, Lin Xiaowan was very cute, playful, and sensible. Lin Xiaowan even knew how to make various kinds of pastries. Most people would be willing to let Lin Xiaowan do whatever she wanted.\nAfter eating a meat floss bread roll, Hong Minhua said, \u201cIn any case, you just started taking art lessons. Even when you don\u2019t have classes, you have to remember to practice, understand?\u201d\n\u201cI know,\u201d Lin Xiaowan nodded vigorously and said, \u201cI really like drawing and painting. I\u2019m not doing it half-heartedly. I\u2019m serious about learning, and I usually practice when I don\u2019t have classes.\u201d\nHong Minhua patted Lin Xiaowan\u2019s head affectionately and said, \u201cThat\u2019s good. Alright, let\u2019s start our lesson.\u201d\nAt the Huo Corporation\u2019s headquarters.\nHuo Zheng read the message and shook his head with a smile. Then, he dialed Assistant Song\u2019s number and asked the latter to get something from the first floor.\n\nAssistant Song had run this errand many times so he knew what it was. He did not ask any questions and happily agreed.\nBecause Huo Zheng usually sent Assistant Song to get the pastries, Lin Xiaowan would usually also include a share for Assistant Song. She was unaware that Huo Zheng had more than one assistant so she was also unaware that Assistant Song\u2019s colleagues would look at him jealously and curiously every time she sent pastries over.\nHuo Zheng was not usually strict with his subordinates as long they did not neglect their work and completed their work on time. In general, the work environment was relatively relaxed. For this reason, Assistant Song\u2019s colleagues were very unrestrained and would often threaten or bribe him to share the pastries with them. After all, who would not want to try the lady boss\u2019 cooking?\nWhen the receptionist on the first floor received the takeout boxes, she called the president\u2019s office. Then, she quickly brought her phone out and took two photos as she waited for Assistant Song to arrive.\nInitially, when the receptionists first received the pink takeout boxes and saw that it was for Huo Zheng, they assumed that it was a gift from some rich young woman. After all, there were cases of rich young women giving Huo Zheng gifts in the past. However, when they informed Assistant Song about it, he would tell her to throw them away or return them if they were too expensive.\nHowever, the first time this happened, Assistant Song personally came down to receive the package with a smile on his face. He even told them to inform him immediately the next time they received similar packages. Most importantly, he told them that if the person who delivered the package was a beautiful young woman, they had to try and make the other party stay no matter what.\nInitially, the receptionists did not understand. When it happened the second time, they finally could not help but ask Assistant Song about it. When they found out that the lady boss personally made the pastries, they could not help but look forward to the pastries. It was a pity they did not have a share of it. They were really envious of Assistant Song who was given similar treatment as their boss; they also wanted the lady boss\u2019 pastries.\nHowever, the receptionist on the first floor was unaware of Assistant Song\u2019s pain and joy in the president\u2019s office. Every time there was a package for Huo Zheng, his colleagues would gather around him.\nThe receptionists were very enthusiastic and curious. Every time there was a package for Huo Zheng, they would wait for Assistant Song to come down, hoping he would open the package to let them have a look. After that, they would all take photos.\nWith this, the number of people who wanted to eat the lady boss\u2019 cooking grew day by day.\nAlas, Lin Xiaowan did not personally send the packages until now. When everyone discussed this matter, they could only dig out information from a few people who attended the company\u2019s annual gala.\n\nWhen Assistant Song arrived at the front desk, three people on duty gathered around him immediately.\n\u201cAssistant Song, you must show us what\u2019s in the package today!\u201d\nThey had already turned their cameras on.\nAssistant Song was also very cooperative. He opened the package so the others could take a look before he briskly walked to the elevator.\nAfter that, the receptionist quickly reported her findings in the group chat.\n[Receptionist: Ahh! The lady boss sent snacks for afternoon tea again! They\u2019re meat floss bread rolls. The fillings and the dressing are really generous!]\n[Employee 1: Who\u2019s jealous?]\n[Employee 2: Me! Me! I\u2019m so envious of those working in the president\u2019s office! I\u2019m so envious of Assistant Song! [crying emoji)]\nThe receptionist almost cried tears of envy as she continued chatting.\n[Receptionist: Moreover, I saw the portion that the lady boss gave Assistant Song today is much more generous than what she gave the boss! The boss actually lost today!]\n[Employee 3: Ah! I\u2019m going crazy! I want to eat the pastries made by the lady boss!]\n[Employee 2: Since Assistant has such a big portion, it doesn\u2019t matter if I ask for a bite, right?!]\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

Alas, contrary to her desire, her baking was not consistent; sometimes it was a success, and sometimes it was a failure. There was a time when the glutinous balls she made turned green. At that time, the chef did not know whether to laugh or cry when he saw it.\nWhen Huo Zheng learned about her desire to open a dessert shop, he said with a smile, \u201cYou can open the shop next to the company. There are many people in the company who want to eat the desserts you make.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s embarrassing\u2026\u201d\nIf she opened up a dessert shop, she would definitely be at the store to sell the desserts. What if Huo Zheng\u2019s employees came to watch her? It would make her extremely nervous. What if she gave the wrong change? What if they thought her desserts were not delicious? However, there was also a possibility that they would not recognize her.\n\u2018That\u2019s right! Only a few people have seen me before! I\u2019m not a celebrity or anything so how could people recognize me?\u2019\n\nWith this thought in mind, Lin Xiaowan no longer felt nervous.\nHong Minhua had to leave for a business trip, but before she left, she did not forget to give Lin Xiaowan homework.\nInitially, Hong Minhua wanted Lin Xiaowan to join the students from a class to go out and sketch. However, Lin Xiaowan was hesitant. In the end, she had no choice but to give Lin Xiaowan more homework.\nAlthough the homework seemed like a lot, it was really not much. Lin Xiaowan managed to finish it in a few days and returned to the kitchen again.\nWhenever the chef was around, the chef wanted to help Lin Xiaowan. However, Lin Xiaowan\u2019s skills were really average. She did not even know how to cut meat. She looked at the meat for a long time, but she could not find its grain. Even after the patient chef taught her in detail, she still could not find the grain of the meat.\nIn the end, Lin Xiaowan was too embarrassed to trouble the chef to help her so she silently retreated when it was time for the chef to cook.\nOn a Saturday morning.\nQiao You\u2019an called Lin Xiaowan and asked, \u201cXiaowan, you were thinking about opening up a dessert shop, right? Why don\u2019t I bring you to meet a business partner?\u201d\n\n\u201cHuh?\u201d\n\u2018Do I need a business partner?\u2019\nThis was Lin Xiaowan\u2019s first time having afternoon tea with wealthy ladies. She was very nervous even though Qiao You\u2019an was with her. She held her bag with both hands and greeted everyone according to Qiao You\u2019an\u2019s instructions.\nApart from Qiao You\u2019an, the other ladies were quite a bit older than Lin Xiaowan. Lin Xiaowan could not help but feel as though she was of the same generation as Huo Dabao and Huo Erbao when she was with them.\nThe ladies were friendly and did not put on air. One of them, Zhu Yingyue, was the business partner that Qiao You\u2019an previously mentioned.\nZhu Yingyue was a full-time housewife. She graduated with a master\u2019s degree and married her husband a few years after she graduated. She was 27 years old when she got married so she was a little anxious to have children.\nUnfortunately, the more anxious she was, the more fruitless her quest to have children became. Finally, after two years of marriage, she finally gave birth to a daughter. When her daughter turned four, she gave birth to a son.\nZhu Yingyue had never worked before and had been focused on taking care of her family. She lived a good life and had a lot of help at home so she was quite relaxed. The only thing was that her husband was very busy and rarely came home. Fortunately, her husband was quite good to her as well. He would remember events like birthdays and anniversaries and would plan all kinds of surprises for her. This made up for his shortcoming.\nZhu Yingyue had nothing to do when her children were in school. Thinking that was once a top finance student, she wanted to be by her husband\u2019s side and be a capable assistant. However, her husband refused her by giving her all sorts of excuses. At that time, she began to feel that something was amiss. It had to be said that a woman\u2019s sixth sense was terrifyingly accurate. She soon found out that her husband had an affair with his secretary. Not only that, the two even had a family; the secretary had given birth to his child.\nNeedless to say, Zhu Yingyue was shocked by her discovery..\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

After all, she could not tell that something was going on when the secretary came over for dinner in the past. The secretary was polite just like an ordinary employee.\nZhu Yingyue was unsurprisingly angry and wanted to leave, but her husband brought out their premarital agreement. It was then that she remembered that if she divorced him now, she would not get a single cent. She had not worked for over ten years and did not have any savings.\nIt was easy to go from being impoverished to being rich. However, it was difficult to go from being rich to being impoverished. She thought about it for a long time before she finally chose to tolerate her husband. Her husband was also shameless and continued on as though nothing had happened.\nLife went on as usual, and he continued to celebrate all kinds of events with her. The only difference was her husband no longer used work as an excuse when he was spending time with his mistress. He would tell her bluntly to be more magnanimous. After all, he could see that Zhu Yingyue was unable to let go of the luxurious life she was living, and he was right. Moreover, she was not a very prideful person, to begin with.\nLin Xiaowan was greatly shocked after hearing the story.\n\u201cAnd then what happened?\u201d\n\nZhu Yingyue smiled, looking nonchalant as though she did not have a care in the world. She replied, \u201cNothing happened. I didn\u2019t divorce him until now and I\u2019m just continuing on with my life\u2026\u201d\nThen, she added self-deprecatingly, \u201cYou might look down on me. After all, sometimes, I also look down on myself. My husband cheated on me, and the third party even gave birth to a child. However, I actually tolerated it because he\u2019s rich.\u201d\nAt this time, the ladies were gathered in an exclusive clubhouse. It had all kinds of facilities there. For example, they were now in a private semi-open kitchen making butter biscuits as they chatted. If they needed anything, they only needed to call, and the butler would send whatever they needed over.\nLin Xiaowan hurriedly waved her hand and said, \u201cNo, no, everyone has their own reason for doing things. Who am 1 to judge?\u201d\nIn fact, Lin Xiaowan felt that she had a lot in common with Zhu Yingyue. The latter got married not long after graduation and had never worked before. She met and got together with Huo Zheng as soon as she graduated, and not counting her part-time job, she had never entered the workforce before. Although she had not married Huo Zheng yet and had no intention of doing so for now, if nothing went wrong, she would marry Huo Zheng in the end. She really could not imagine being with another person other than Huo Zheng.\nAfter thinking about it for a while, Lin Xiaowan concluded that the most important thing was to make money. With enough money, she would be able to do many things with confidence.\nAfter a pause, Lin Xiaowan asked, \u201cWhy did you suddenly think of opening a dessert shop?\nZhu Yingyue placed the dough in the freezer and as she said with a bitter smile, \u201cIn fact, I didn\u2019t even consider this in the beginning.\u201d\nZhu Yingyue was a top financial student when she was at university. Naturally, the first thing she thought of was getting a job related to finance. However, she was forty this year and had zero relevant work experience. When she tried looking for a job, she was met with failure over and over again. Among the jobs she applied for, she was only called back for interviews with small companies. However, after her interview, she realized how completely out-of-depth she was professionally.\n\nZhu Yingyue really regretted getting married so soon after graduation. However, after returning home, when she was served by the help at home and saw the steaming food on the table, she felt that it might not be that bad to turn a blind eye to things, living life without worrying about food, shelter, and clothes.\nZhu Yingyue did not go into details and simply said to Lin Xiaowan, \u201cIt\u2019s not easy to find a job related to my major. Moreover, I\u2019m interested in desserts. I\u2019ve learned baking for a while so I thought it might be a good idea to open up a dessert shop.\u201d\nThen, Zhu Yingyue asked Lin Xiaowan, \u201cActually, I\u2019m curious as well. Why do you want to open a dessert shop?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan looked a little embarrassed as she said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to spend Huo Zheng\u2019s money all the time. I\u2019ve been spending his money until now. I\u2019m jobless so he has been supporting me.\u201d\nZhu Yingyue sighed. \u201cI\u2019ve been married to my husband for so many years that I thought it only right for me to spend his money\u2026 However, when something happened, I finally realized that I really have no one to rely on\u2026\u201d\nThe two of them got to know each other today, but they did not talk much about the dessert shop. They exchanged contact information and agreed to meet again when they were free.\nWhen Lin Xiaowan returned, she was absent-minded. She would look at Huo Zheng occasionally.\nHowever, when Huo Zheng asked her about it, she would only shake her head and said that she was fine.\nShe was thinking about the future. She thought about what would happen in ten years. If she did not change and gave birth to a child, doing whatever she wanted and spending Huo Zheng\u2019s money, she wondered if Huo Zheng would fall in love with another person. What would happen if he did?\nShe did not discuss this matter with Huo Zheng. After all, this was just her thoughts and speculations. She could not simply jump to conclusions..\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

She was only 24 years old this year. Even if she only lived until she was 60, there were still 36 years left. Could Huo Zheng really love her for so many decades? If Huo Zheng fell in love with someone else and no longer wanted her, what would she do?\nLin Xiaowan sighed heavily. For some reason, she was not very optimistic about everlasting love. After thinking about it for a while, she managed to calm down and even felt that she was thinking too much. After all, what was the point of worrying about something that might or might not happen? Was it not too good to live life in the present?\nLin Xiaowan\u2019s gaze inadvertently drifted to Huo Zheng again.\nHuo Zheng noticed her gaze, and his already straight back straightened even more. His eyes were trained on the article displayed on the tablet, but he could not read a word at all.\nLin Xiaowan looked at Huo Zheng\u2019s side profile. His jawline was extremely distinct. He had a high nose bridge and a pair of bright eyes. There was no doubt that he was extremely handsome. Although he was usually expressionless, his expression was very gentle whenever he looked at her.\nAlthough Huo Zheng was dressed in a black long-sleeved shirt with two buttons undone, Lin Xiaowan knew he had a very good figure as well. His abdomen and chest were muscular; he had wide shoulders and narrow hips.\nEven during intimate moments, he was very considerate of her. She was completely under his control when she was with him.\nMeanwhile, Huo Zheng could feel Lin Xiaowan\u2019s gaze sliding down his body. Although she was only studying him in a daze, he could not help but feel a trace of heat.\nLin Xiaowan was completely unaware of this and continued to size him up. In the end, she felt like she gained much by being with such an extraordinary man. At the same time, she was also determined to change. She had been working hard recently, and she even dared to act in a drama.\nAfter thinking things through, Lin Xiaowan stood up and said in a leisurely tone, \u201cI\u2019m going downstairs to drink milk.\u201d\nHuo Zheng watched her leave. After she vanished out of sight, he closed the new articles.\n\nWhen Lin Xiaowan returned, Huo Zheng said with a serious expression, \u201cQingqing, come here.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Lin Xiaowan asked, puzzled.\n\u201cWhat happened today?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan was unaware that Huo Zheng had noticed that something was wrong with her earlier. Moreover, she had already thought things through. Hence, she said, \u201cNothing much. Why?\u201d\nHuo Zheng was silent for a moment. After he studied her expression, he confirmed that she was not lying. Then, he said, \u201cYou\u2019ve been acting weird since you came back.\u201d\n\u2018What? Was I so obvious?\u2019\nLin Xiaowan was stunned.\nHuo Zheng\u2019s gaze was dark as he called out, \u201cQingqing.\u201d\n\u201cAh?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan returned to her senses. She was worried that he would misunderstand so she hurriedly explained, \u201cI was just thinking about a problem, but I\u2019ve already figured it out.\u201d\nHuo Zheng stared at her silently.\nLin Xiaowan felt guilty the longer he stared at her. After all, how could she tell him that she felt that he might cheat on her in the future? She had no basis for this thought at all.\nWhen Huo Zheng saw Lin Xiaowan averting her eyes guiltily, he became even more suspicious. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan did not dare to look at Huo Zheng. She pretended to cough twice before she lowered her head and vaguely replied, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. I went out with Sister You\u2019an today, right? I heard one of the ladies\u2019 stories so I began to overthink things\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat story?\u201d\nHuo Zheng was determined to get to the bottom of the matter today.\n\u201cWhy are you so interested in another person\u2019s story?\u201d Lin Xiaowan asked defensively, seeing how persistent Huo Zheng was.\nLin Xiaowan was panicking inwardly, but Huo Zheng was very calm. He continued to look at her silently. In the end, she could no longer endure it and quickly put away her claws and waved the white flag. She said, \u201cAlright, alright, I admit I was thinking about a bunch of nonsense.\u201d\nThen, Lin Xiaowan briefly told Huo Zheng about what happened to Zhu Yingyue. She also told him about what she had been struggling with the entire night.\nAfter listening to Lin Xiaowan, Huo Zheng felt a little hurt. He asked, \u201cWhat makes you think I\u2019ll cheat on you?\u201d\nSeeing that Huo Zheng was upset, she quickly pounced over to hug him and said apologetically, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. 1 don\u2019t know why I\u2019d think that as well\u2026\u201d\nShe stammered as she explained, \u201cI\u2026 But 1 thought things through after a long time. In the end, I\u2026 1 concluded that you wouldn\u2019t do such a thing\u2026\u201d\n\u201cHowever, from what you told me, it seems like you don\u2019t really believe in your own conclusion\u2026\u201d Huo Zheng said unhappily. Moreover, when she said she had thought things through and figured it out, it was nothing more than her concluding that she would be able to live well alone in the future if something happened. He was naturally upset by her lack of confidence in him.\nApart from being angered by her distrust, Huo Zheng also thought about why she had such thoughts. Finally, he asked seriously, \u201cDid 1 not give you enough sense of security?\u201d\n\u25a0Otherwise, why would she have these thoughts?\u2019\nLin Xiaowan tilted her head and thought about it. In the end, she said, \u201cI feel secure enough, 1 think.\u201d\nHowever, she did not sound very certain when she spoke.\nHuo Zheng sighed heavily before he gently pushed her away. \u201cSit properly.

In her mind, there was only one answer.\n\u201cI said after being married\u2026\u201d Huo Zheng emphasized the word \u2018married\u2019.\n\u201cGet a divorce,\u201d Lin Xiaowan said weakly.\nIt was not good to bring up the past, but at this moment, Lin Xiaowan could not help but think about her previous life. Although she knew that everything that happened in her previous life was just a misunderstanding, she still could not help thinking about it.\nIf Huo Zheng and Song Zhiyi were really together, if she was not hit by a car, if Huo Zheng really asked for a divorce\u2026\n\nThinking about it, Lin Xiaowan thought that she really divorce him and returned to her hometown to spend the rest of her life alone.\nHuo Zheng was very dissatisfied with her answer. He gritted his teeth and said, \u201cVery well.\u201d\nPerhaps he did not restrain or his expression was a little unsightly, Lin Xiaowan patted the back of his hand and said, \u201cYou\u2019re a little fierce now.\u201d\nHuo Zheng was stunned. When he recovered, he held her hand gently and said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\nThen, he asked another question. This time, in a softer tone. \u201cWhat if 1 refuse to give you anything after the divorce, and you have to leave with nothing?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan thought about her question. Although it was hypothetical, she still felt sad when she thought about it. After a moment, she replied, \u201cIt\u2019s fine. After all, it\u2019s all your money.\u201d\nThe house, the car, and the money all belonged to Huo Zheng in the first place. It was quite understandable if he did not want to give her anything.\nHuo Zheng did not expect that Lin Xiaowan would be so calm and accepting. It was as though it was a matter of course that she did not receive anything. He could not help but say, \u201cQingqing, you can\u2019t think that way. How can you accept it just like that? If you were penniless and jobless, have you ever thought about what would happen?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan mulled over his words seriously. If she was penniless and jobless after being abandoned, what would she do? Perhaps, she should find a job first. Could she be a dishwasher? Or perhaps she could look for a part-time job? In short, it did not matter what job it was as long as she could earn money. As for where to stay, would accommodation be provided for temporary workers? Perhaps, she could temporarily live in a shelter? When she saved enough money, she would return to her hometown. However, there was nowhere else for her to go even if she returned to her hometown; she did not even have a home there. She was an unwanted child after all.\n\nNearing the end of her thoughts, her eyes turned red. She could accept being penniless. After all, as long as she was willing, she would be able to find a job to support herself. She could also accept not having a place to say. After all, she could sleep anywhere. However, what she could not accept was being alone again. She would return to being lonely and helpless, living her life shrouded in a cloud of fog. The world was so big, but no one wanted her. It would just be like the first twenty-one years of her life; no one wanted her.\nThinking about this, tears welled up in Lin Xiaowan\u2019s eyes. She widened her eyes to stop her tears from falling, but she failed miserably. It was as though she could already feel the loneliness. She was extremely sad.\nLin Xiaowan\u2019s head was lowered so Huo Zheng could not see her expression. However, when he saw her heavy breathing, he could tell that something was wrong. He ignored her resistance and made her raise her head. When he saw her face was wet with tears, his heart ached. He pulled her into his arms and said gently, \u201cAlright, alright, 1 won\u2019t talk about this anymore.\u201d\nHe sighed and continued to say, \u201cNone of that would happen. 1 love you very much.\u201d\nHuo Zheng was rarely so straightforward. As such, she cried even harder when she heard those words.\nNo matter what, the world would continue spinning, and the sun would continue to rise. However, Lin Xiaowan felt that she really could not go on without Huo Zheng.\nHuo Zheng felt that he had made her cry so he continued to coax her gently. He thought she was crying because of what he had said. He said, \u201cDon\u2019t be angry. I was wrong, okay?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan was emotional, but she calmed down very quickly. She sniffed and said with teary eyes, \u201cI\u2019m not angry. It\u2019s just that\u2026 If you don\u2019t want me, then 1\u201911 be alone. No one wants me. 1,1 just felt a little sad when I thought about that.\u201d\nHuo Zheng\u2019s breathing hitched slightly, and his heart softened.\n\u2018Why is this girl so lovable?\u2019\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

No matter what, you still have to fight for yourself, understand? You can\u2019t just go along with everything others say.\u201d\nAlthough his expression was serious, his voice was gentle, and the love and affection in his eyes could not be hidden at all.\n\u201cEven if, I say if, we get married and I fall in love with someone else,\u201d Huo Zheng said. He paused for a moment, choosing his words carefully before he continued to say, \u201cYou should quarrel with me, scold me, or hit me. In short, you have to fight for your own interest, understand?\u201d\nAs soon as he finished speaking, he instantly regretted it. He felt like he did not articulate his thoughts properly. In the end, he said, \u201cForget it. I won\u2019t wrong you no matter what.\u201d\n\u201cBut\u2026 Don\u2019t you think that\u2019s a little unreasonable if I act like that?\u201d\nHuo Zheng glanced at her and said lightly, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re unreasonable.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan was stunned by his words. After a long while, she said, \u201cWell said. If you work a little harder, you can officially become my boyfriend.\u201d \u201cHuh?\u201d Huo Zheng said with a frown, \u201cDidn\u2019t you already acknowledge me previously?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, don\u2019t talk nonsense,\u201d Lin Xiaowan said, breaking free of his embrace, \u201cYou\u2019re still in the trial period. If you don\u2019t perform well, see if I don\u2019t fire you\u2026\u201d\nHuo Zheng laughed and shook his head. He did not argue with her and let her be.\nA few days later, Zhu Yingyue took the initiative to contact Lin Xiaowan, saying that she wanted to meet to talk about the dessert shop. She proposed to meet at her house.\nLin Xiaowan did not have a good impression of Zhu Yingyue who cheated so she asked tentatively, \u201cWill you be home alone?\u201d\nZhu Yingyue\u2019s tone was a little bitter even though she tried to be nonchalant. \u201cYes. He\u2019s at work.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan could not help but feel sorry for Zhu Yingyue since she could hear Zhu Yingyue\u2019s bitterness. It was likely that her husband was not busy with work.\nZhu Yingyue\u2019s house was close to Huo Zheng\u2019s company. It was located in a very expensive area that was quiet, beautiful, and green. The residential area was separated from the noisy downtown area.\nAlthough Lin Xiaowan and Huo Zheng lived in a high-rise building, the environment around the building was also verdant and beautiful. However, compared to this place, it was still quite far from the city. There were not many people, and getting food delivered could also be difficult.\nZhu Yingyue\u2019s home was very lively because of her children. Toys and all kinds of children\u2019s things were scattered everywhere. Although it was messy, it was clean. The color of the house was very warm and cozy, and it was clear that it had been carefully decorated.\nAfter changing into the guest\u2019s slippers, Lin Xiaowan handed the gift she had brought over for her visit.\n\nZhu Yingyue did not expect Lin Xiaowan to give her a gift, and she was pleasantly surprised.\nZhu Yingyue did not have many friends all these years. She mostly interacted with other mothers, and it could get quite exhausting since they had a tendency to compete, which was annoying.\nLin Xiaowan told Zhu Yingyue about her thoughts after she spoke to Huo Zheng. She said, \u201cYou\u2019ve been married to him for so many years. How can you just accept him cheating on you? You should make a scene and fight for your own interest.\u201d\nZhu Yingyue was dressed in a long green dress today. Her black hair was carefully pulled to the back, making her look gentle and elegant. However, there was a hint of sorrow in the depths of her eyes, making her look a little bitter.\nLin Xiaowan stared at Zhu Yingyue and discovered that the latter had quite a bit of white hair hidden among her black hair. Her expression was calm, but she was inwardly frightened. In her mind, only middle-aged people would have white hair. She did not expect Zhu Yingyue to already have white hair. After all, Zhu Yingyue did not look her age, and she had the unique charm of a mature and intellectual woman.\nZhu Yingyue looked at the young woman who spoke to her seriously, and she felt melancholic. She felt that Lin Xiaowan\u2019s words were very naive, but she also envied Lin Xiaowan for retaining her naivete, still untainted by the passage of life and time.\n\u201cLet\u2019s not talk about our premarital agreement first,\u201d Zhu Yingyue said with a hint of self-mocking, \u201cEven if I make a fuss, what capital do 1 have to make a fuss with him? I\u2019m not capable. My parents also can\u2019t help me. Will he give in just because I make a fuss? If 1 make a fuss, he\u2019s probably going to make things even more difficult for me. I\u2019m materialistic after all\u2026\u201d\nLin Xiaowan did not know what to say to these words.\nUpon seeing this, Zhu Yingyue realized she had let her emotions get the better of her. She laughed and led Lin Xiaowan to the kitchen as she said, \u201cAlright, let\u2019s forget about him. I baked a cake today.\u201d\nZhu Yingyue invited Lin Xiaowan over today because she had thought about it and decided to open up a shop. She wanted to explore Lin Xiaowan\u2019s thoughts again.\nLin Xiaowan was usually indecisive. However, if someone had a definite direction and idea, she would follow along. To put it bluntly, she was a fence-sitter without a backbone.\n\u201cI don\u2019t have any experience\u2026 I don\u2019t even know what to do after opening the shop,\u201d Lin Xiaowan said, looking slightly embarrassed.. She did not hide her shortcomings as she continued to say, \u201cI don\u2019t know how to do accounting, and I don\u2019t have relevant management experience\u2026 If we open a shop together, can I just stay in the shop and sell our goods?\u201d\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

Although Zhu Yingyue kept saying she was a materialistic woman, Zhu Yingyue was very clear and easygoing in regard to money. Moreover, Lin Xiaowan did not have to worry about the management of the shop and had complete freedom. If she wanted to sell the desserts, she could do it. If she did not want to do it, she did not have to do it.\nHuo Zheng was very satisfied after reading the contract. There were no flaws and everything was very clear. It was obvious that Zhu Yingyue had gotten a professional to draw up the contract.\nWhen Huo Zheng finally agreed, Zhu Yingyue sighed in relief inwardly. When Huo Zheng went out to make a call, leaving only her and Lin Xiaowan, she felt the atmosphere become lighter immediately. She inhaled deeply and said to Lin Xiaowan, \u201cSecond Master Huo is really imposing. Don\u2019t you feel pressured when you\u2019re with him?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan could not empathize with Zhu Yingyue at all. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t feel any pressure at all when I\u2019m with him.\u201d\nIf anything, Lin Xiaowan was the one who put pressure on herself. Huo Zheng did not expect anything from her, but she would always overthink things.\nAs for Zhu Yingyue, she felt that being around someone as imposing as Huo Zheng was very oppressive. Moreover, based on the couple\u2019s interaction, she could tell that Huo Zheng was the dominant one. During the meal, Lin Xiaowan rarely had to raise her chopsticks since Huo Zheng would pick the dishes for her, and he even controlled the amount of fruit juice she drank. Under such circumstances, she could not help but wonder if Lin Xiaowan was truly happy.\n\nHowever, although Zhu Yingyue had her doubts, she was very tactful and did not say anything. After all, that was a matter between the couple.\nIn fact, Zhu Yingyue was overthinking things. On the surface, it seemed like Huo Zheng controlled Lin Xiaowan\u2019s life. However, that was only because Lin Xiaowan gave him that control. If anything, it would have been easy for Lin Xiaowan to wrestle the control away from him.\nLin Xiaowan asked curiously, \u201cWhy do you call him Second Master Huo?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s what everyone calls him, right?\u201d Zhu Yingyue said with a hint of uncertainty. She had heard many people referring to Huo Zheng as Second Master Huo.\nLin Xiaowan\u2019s curiosity did not dissipate. When she reached home, she asked Huo Zheng about it.\nHuo Zheng also did not have the answer to this. He did not know when people began to call him Second Master Huo. After thinking about it carefully, he thought that it probably started when Huo Cheng began to handle important matters of the country. Huo Cheng was among the group of power who had control of central power so people began to address him as Master Huo. Perhaps for that reason, considering he was Huo Cheng\u2019s younger brother, when people met him, they began to refer to him as Second Master Huo.\nLin Xiaowan commented, \u201cIt sounds really imposing and intimidating\u2026\u201d\nThe store that they bought for the dessert shop was originally a clothing store. It would take a long time for them to renovate it.\nZhu Yingyue used her free time to study and learn how to improve the store.\nLin Xiaowan would often hang out with Zhu Yingyue, and the more she did so, the more familiar she became with the latter\u2019s children.\n\nDuring the weekend, Lin Xiaowan and Zhu Yingyue tried making bubble tea together. The two children were at home, watching cartoons in the living room. It was supposed to be a peaceful afternoon, but Zhu Yingyue\u2019s husband suddenly returned.\nIt was already bad enough that he returned unexpectedly, but he actually brought his secretary with him.\nThe secretary was dressed professionally. She had a voluptuous figure, and her chestnut brown hair hung down in front of her chest. She also had a very expressive face.\nKnowing that Zhu Yingyue would not welcome her, the secretary stood at the door and did not come in. She wore a gentle smile on her face and did not seem to mind Zhu Yingyue who was looking at her with resentment and disgust.\nLin Xiaowan sized the secretary up curiously. The other party even nodded politely at her and acted magnanimously. It seemed like the other party did not feel guilty at all for ruining someone else\u2019s family. The other party looked especially open and aboveboard.\nLin Xiaowan felt that the secretary\u2019s mentality was truly extraordinary.\nZhu Yingyue\u2019s husband returned to get his work documents. He went upstairs and came down in a hurry. Before he left, he even had time to tease his two children. He even wanted to hug Zhu Yingyue before he left, but she pushed him away.\nWhen he reached the door, the secretary reached out and adjusted his tie and collar. After that, he put his arm around her waist and left. When they reached the car, he even opened the car door for her.\nZhu Yingyue watched the entire process expressionlessly.\nEven after Lin Xiaowan got home, she was still dumbfounded by what she had witnessed. She quickly told Huo Zheng about what happened before she grabbed his collar and asked him fiercely, \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you also have such a flirtatious secretary?\u201d\nHuo Zheng raised his hands in a gesture of surrender as he said, \u201cMy Secretary-General is a man.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan raised an eyebrow.. \u201cSecretary-General? Does this mean you have a lot of secretaries?\u201d\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

It was only natural that Huo Zheng had more than one secretary. He had many things to deal with every day, and if he had just one secretary, the other party would definitely burn out.\n\u201cThere are eight secretaries under the Secretary-General.\u201d\n\u201cSo you have nine secretaries in total?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan had only met Assistant Song. After finding out that Huo Zheng had so many secretaries, she could not help but ask, \u201cThen, do you have a lot of assistants as well?\u201d\n\u201cAssistant Song is the only one who liaises with me.\u201d\nIn other words, Huo Zheng had other assistants as well, but Huo Zheng did not have much contact with them. It was the same for the secretaries as well; they usually did not have many chances to interact with Huo Zheng.\n\u201cSince you\u2019re so curious, why don\u2019t you come to the company to have a look?\u201d Huo Zheng suggested.\nLin Xiaowan was not interested at all. She said without hesitation, \u201cNo, it\u2019s okay.\u201d\n\nIn her opinion, it would be boring to visit the company. Everyone would be working, and what was she going to do? Stand by the window and look at the scenery? Or should she act like the boss and inspect the employees? Forget it. If anything, the employees were more likely to inspect her.\nAt the beginning of June, Gu Yuwu returned from filming. She knew that Lin Xiaowan was preparing to open a dessert shop so she went to have a look.\nLin Xiaowan was very enthusiastic when she showed Gu Yuwu around, explaining in detail the division of labor.\nGu Yuwu nodded and said, \u201cThe location is very good. I\u2019m sure that many will come when you open your store.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe there\u2019ll be people who come just to satisfy their curiosity as well\u2026\u201d\nThe matter between Zhu Yingyue and her husband was not out in the open, but those in the same circle were vaguely aware of it. Although they were aware of it, they also tactfully remained silent. Since the people involved seemed to have come to an agreement, outsiders naturally would not come up and cause trouble for no reason. At most, they would gossip about it among themselves.\nGu Yuwu said, \u201cThat\u2019s right. There may be people who\u2019ll come just to see you.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s there to see?\u201d\nGu Yuwu smiled and said, \u201cAfter all, you have Huo Zheng. There are only advantages and no disadvantages if they get close to you\u2026 You might know this yourself, but you\u2019re quite famous in the circle of aristocratic families and celebrities. You don\u2019t attend many events and the Huo family also rarely mentions you so people are even more curious about you\u2026\u201d\nAs they walked down from the second floor, Gu Yuwu suddenly had an idea. She said, \u201cWhen the time comes, you can turn the second floor into a VIP area for those wealthy ladies. Create a separate price list for the. For example, a slice of cake on the first floor cost 18 yuan, but it\u2019ll cost 78 yuan on the second floor.\u201d\n\u201cNo, no. It won\u2019t look good for the store if this gets out. Moreover, those people might not even come. The second floor is so spacious. If those ladies you mentioned didn\u2019t come, it\u2019ll be a waste of space,\u201d Lin Xiaowan said, refusing decisively.\n\nGu Yuwu smiled and did not say anything.\nThose wealthy ladies were idle and could be found everywhere. What kind of status did the Huo family have? Many families could not compare to the Huo family at all. Now that an opportunity to build a connection to the Huo family was given to them, how could they not seize it? It was likely that many were eager to come and get to know Lin Xiaowan.\nWhen the two of them stood at the door, Gu Yuwu took a few steps forward and pointed to a seat by the window as she said domineeringly, \u201cYou\u2019ll have a private room on the second floor, right? Save this window seat for me, do you hear me? I want to be the first patron of your shop.\u201d\n\u201cAlright.\u201d\nIn June, the weather in Shengjing was quite good, and it was suitable for traveling.\nGu Yuwu wanted to take photos so she brought Lin Xiaowan out with her to have fun. The model this time was someone Lin Xiaowan was familiar with; it was none other than Chang Ning, the actress who played a valiant character in the fantasy drama.\nChang Ning was dressed casually today, and her short hair fell around the nape of her neck. All in all, she looked good. She leaned against the entrance of the subway station lazily. Her head was lowered, and she was wearing a mask. She was looking at her phone expressionlessly at this moment.\nSeeing that Chang Ning was unaware of their presence, Gu Yuwu quietly raised her camera and took a photo of Chang Ning.\n\u201cShe looks so cool like this\u2026\u201d\nChang Ning looked aloof and distant. She did not look like she was waiting for someone. Instead, she looked like she was waiting for her subordinate.\nHowever, when Chang Ning looked up and saw the two young women, the aloof expression on her face vanished immediately. Her eyes curved immediately. Even if her mouth was covered, it was clear that she was smiling. She no longer looked as unapproachable as before. She straightened her back as they walked over.\nChang Ning was dressed in her usual attire today, looking cool and cool. She casually leaned against the entrance of the subway station, her short black hair messy around her neck. She had her head lowered and a mask on her face. She was holding her phone in one hand and looking at it expressionlessly.\nBased on Gu Yuwu\u2019s style, they took the photos casually. There was no fixed location or setting. They wandered around and took photos as they went..\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

There were also solo photos of Lin Xiaowan.\nLin Xiaowan\u2019s favorite photo was the one Gu Yuwu took for her when she sat by the window eating half a watermelon with a silver spoon, looking very energetic. She specially asked for the photo and used it as her profile picture on her social media.\nApart from photos, Gu Yuwu also took videos. She planned to choose a few photos and give them to her models.\nLin Xiaowan was not very willing to appear in front of the camera. As such, Gu Yuwu edited Lin Xiaowan out of the video as much as she could. Mostly, only Lin Xiaowan\u2019s back, hands, or legs could be seen, and only her voice could be heard.\nLin Xiaowan was very photogenic. Previously, when Lin Xiaowan was filming for the character of the goddess, Gu Yuwu had already noticed that. Although Lin Xiaowan had never gone through training and was reserved, she generally looked beautiful in front of the camera no matter the angle. One of the reasons was Lin Xiaowan\u2019s good posture. When she was feeling shy, she would not dare to look at the camera. She would lower her head, but her shoulders and back were straight.\nGu Yuwu sighed when she edited the video. If it was possible, she really wanted to leave Lin Xiaowan in the video so everyone could see.\nLin Xiaowan had been very busy recently. Apart from the dessert shop, she was also busy drawing and painting for Huo Zheng.\nAfter Hong Minima returned from her business trip, she brought Lin Xiaowan outside to sketch.\nThe location was not far, and it was also in Shengjing. However, it was not in Shengjing\u2019s Academy of Fine Arts. Instead, it was at the sports department next door. They were sketching in the sports stadium to practice sketching the movements and expressions of others.\nThe two of them sat on a bench next to the basketball court. The weather was quite hot so the boys wore sleeveless shirts when they played basketball.\nIt was not surprising that everyone\u2019s figures were really good since they were from the sports department. When they lifted their hands casually to wipe the sweat off their faces, the hem of their shirts would rise a little.\n\nLin Xiaowan was in a daze as she watched them. She secretly took a photo and cropped out the subjects\u2019 faces. Unafraid of death, she did not only send the photo to Huo Zheng, but she even added a drooling emoji.\n[Huo Zheng: ?]\n[Lin Xiaowan: I think these people\u2019s figures aren\u2019t as good as yours.]\n[Huo Zheng: Oh?]\nHuo Zheng\u2019s birthday banquet was held three days in advance. In her previous life, after getting married, she only attended the banquet once. She found it boring so she never went again.\nTo put it bluntly, the banquet was a chance for people to socialize and build connections. At that time, she stood next to Huo Zheng silently and maintained a smile on her face the entire night. She felt her facial muscles were stiff from smiling for so long. She also had to make sure that her etiquette was right. Although Huo Zheng did not move around a lot, he would be the center of attention wherever he went. Everyone\u2019s eyes were on him, and it made Lin Xiaowan feel very pressured.\nMoreover, the banquet aside, she would have dinner with Huo Zheng again to celebrate his birthday. This also contributed to the reason she stopped attending the birthday banquets.\nIn fact, in Lin Xiaowan\u2019s previous life, many people misunderstood and assumed that Lin Xiaowan and Huo Zheng did not get along because she only attended his birthday banquet once. Moreover, Huo Zheng did not know about the rumors since no one dared to say anything to him. However, even if he knew about the rumor, he was not the type to clarify the rumors. At most, he would frown, causing others to misunderstand even more that the two did not get along.\nIt was the same this year. When Huo Zheng asked if Lin Xiaowan would attend the banquet, she said no. Not only did she refuse him, but she also complained, \u201cIt\u2019s too boring. Most of the guests only know how to flatter you, and most of the time, I don\u2019t even understand your conversation. Apart from that, it\u2019s also very tiring to stand all night.\u201d\nHuo Zheng had already expected her refusal, and he also did not force her. This kind of banquet was indeed very boring. Nonetheless, he would still ask for her opinion every time.\nLin Xiaowan had already finished sketching the gift for him. She had hidden it from him all this time, but at this point, she could not help but want to keep him in suspense. She asked, \u201cGuess what gift I prepared for you?\u201d\nRecently, Lin Xiaowan had been visiting Zhu Yingyue\u2019s house a lot. Apart from that, she would either visit the shop or learn from Hong Minhua as usual. There was nothing special about her days. For this reason, it was quite hard for Huo Zheng to guess.\nLin Xiaowan said smugly, \u201cYou can\u2019t guess, right? 1 won\u2019t tell you now. You\u2019ll see it for yourself when the time comes.\u201d\nAlthough the birthday banquet was held at the Huo family\u2019s old residence, Huo Cheng and Qiao You\u2019an would not be present.\n\nApart from the birthday banquet now and the Huo Corporation\u2019s annual gala, Huo Zheng did not attend any events. Many people wanted to meet him, but they could not find him. As such, the birthday banquet was their chance.\nGu Yuwu was present at the birthday banquet as well. Qin Yanchuan stood next to her like a guard dog, glaring at the members of the opposite sex who dared to approach her. If they spoke to her, he would drive them away with his sharp tongue.\nWhen Huo Zheng finished dealing with a guest with a cold expression on his face, Gu Yuwu went forward to toast him before she asked, \u201cXiaowan didn\u2019t come?\u201d\nHuo Zheng nodded as he held his glass with no intention of drinking. He only nodded and did not say anything else.\nGu Yuwu smiled before she scolded, \u201cOnly Xiaowan can stand you.\u201d\nHuo Zheng did not think too much of it. He naturally would not treat outsiders the same way he treated his precious Lin Xiaowan. If Lin Xiaowan were to ask him why someone was absent, he would definitely patiently explain it to her. \u201cDo you want to hike at night and watch the sunrise from the mountain?\u201d\nNot quite understanding why Gu Yuwu would invite him, Huo Zheng only glanced at her and said, \u201cNo.\u201d\nQin Yanchuan snorted and said with a laugh, \u201cAlright. We\u2019re taking your wife away. When the time comes, don\u2019t cry and beg us to bring you along.\u201d\nHuo Zheng looked at Gu Yuwu.\nGu Yuwu held back her laughter and said, \u201cIn fact, 1 haven\u2019t asked Xiaowan yet. I planned to ask her today. Since I ran into you first, 1 decided to ask you first.\u201d It had been a long time since Gu Yuwu filmed a daily vlog. After uploading Chang Ning\u2019s photos and video, many expressed their desire to see her daily life. She was rather free recently so she decided to go out and play, filming a vlog while she was at it.\nHuo Zheng remained silent, indicating that he would wait for Lin Xiaowan\u2019s decision.\nThree days after the birthday banquet was Huo Zheng\u2019s birthday.\nThe family decided to have dinner together.\nLin Xiaowan chose the venue, which was recommended by Gu Yuwu. It was a private restaurant in the east of the city that was close to the public. The menu would also change every day. The customers would have to eat whatever was on the menu; they could not pick and choose. She only needed to make a reservation before going.\nEarly in the morning, Lin Xiaowan seemed even more excited than the birthday boy. As soon as she woke up, she pounced on him and kissed him twice before she cheerfully wished him a happy birthday..\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

A golden flower brooch could be seen on the jacket pocket, and the lion held a bouquet of flowers.\nThe background of the painting was inspired by the garden in the Huo family\u2019s old residence. Lin Xiaowan made many changes to it.\nThe lion\u2019s expression was serious like that of Huo Zheng. It took a long time for her to draw the eyes. She found it difficult to draw Huo Zheng\u2019s deep eyes so she could only focus on using colors to add depth to them. She had asked Hong Minhua for advice as well when she painted this.\nAfter she completed the painting, she carefully framed it.\n\u201cIs that supposed to be me?\u201d Huo Zheng asked as he held her in his arms.\nLin Xiaowan nodded. \u201cDoesn\u2019t it look like you?\u201d\nHuo Zheng and the lion stared at each other. After a while, he nodded and said with a laugh, \u201cYes, it does.\u201d\nWhen the couple returned home from dinner, Lin Xiaowan saw that her painting had been hung above the counter in the dining room. Its spot was very conspicuous, and the painting could be seen as soon as one entered the room. Obviously, Huo Zheng had instructed someone to hang it here.\nLin Xiaowan was very satisfied. After admiring it for a long time, she said to\nHuo Zheng confidently, \u201cI\u2019ll paint you a better one in the future.\u201d\nBefore going to bed, Lin Xiaowan said, looking a little embarrassed, \u201cSince it\u2019s your birthday, I\u2019d like to announce that you\u2019re now officially my boyfriend.\u201d\nHuo Zheng kissed her and whispered, \u201cOkay.\u201d\nIt did not really matter to Huo Zheng, to be honest. In his opinion, they had never broken up and had always been together.\nAfter Huo Zheng\u2019s birthday, Lin Xiaowan agreed to go hiking with Gu Yuwu.\n\nThe weather was just nice and not too hot, about 25 degrees Celcius. Just hiking seemed boring so they decided to have a picnic during the day.\nThey decided to have a picnic in a farmhouse in the western suburbs of Shengjing. This place was also not open to the public, and it was also recommended by Gu Yuwu.\nThe owner of the farmhouse was a couple from the entertainment industry. The mistress of the house liked flowers so there were many flowers around.\nThe scenery was different each season. There was also a large lake where they could fish. All in all, it was a very suitable place to relax.\nThe couple rarely came to the farmhouse so they would allow close friends to come over to relax. Although they were rarely around, they hired people to clean and maintain the place.\nWhen Gu Yuwu first mentioned hiking to Lin Xiaowan, she also told the latter about filming a vlog. After all, she was worried that it would make Lin Xiaowan uncomfortable. She assured Lin Xiaowan that she would not film her face.\nLin Xiaowan did not think much of it. In fact, she felt that it was meaningful to record her life.\nGu Yuwu\u2019s vlog started with the two of them preparing food for the picnic in Lin Xiaowan and Huo Zheng\u2019s house. To be precise, they were only helping the chef prepare the food.\nEver since Lin Xiaowan decided to open a dessert shop with Zhu Yingyue, she had been learning to make desserts with the chef. Although she could not be considered very good, the desserts she made were considered presentable.\nAfter the Huo family\u2019s chef made the food, he would pack it up for them as well to be eaten tomorrow. They decided to prepare the food at Lin Xiaowan\u2019s house because the kitchen here was very complete.\nGu Yuwu pointed the camera at the chef and said, \u201cThis is the chef in charge of our picnic food\u2026\u201d\nThe chef had participated in many prestigious competitions before so he was even more natural in front of the camera than Lin Xiaowan. He was very amiable and waved at the camera before he lowered his head to prep the ingredients.\n\u201cWhen the time comes, I\u2019ll add an introduction for you,\u201d Gu Yuwu said. After all, she still needed to edit the video.\n\u201cThen I\u2019ll be famous at that time,\u201d the chef said with a smile.\nLin Xiaowan rolled up her sleeves and washed her hands, ready to help the chef. She was in high spirits. She said confidently, \u201cI can do simple work. I can definitely do it!\u201d\nWhen learning to make desserts from Zhu Yingyue, Zhu Yingyue would always praise Lin Xiaowan.\nHowever, the chef had seen Lin Xiaowan\u2019s \u2018skills\u2019 before so he could not help but feel skeptical when he heard Lin Xiaowan\u2019s words. Fortunately, they were cooking with semi-finished food products today. After taking everyone\u2019s skills into consideration, he chose a few simple dishes.\nThe chef gave Lin Xiaowan the broccoli and asked her to cut it into small pieces.\nLin Xiaowan had to take care of herself in the past. After so many years, she still knew how to cut broccoli. She cut off the root with a sharp knife before cutting it into small pieces.\nThe chef, who was deboning the chicken at the side, praised Lin Xiaowan when he saw her. \u201cMiss Lin, you\u2019re doing quite well this time.\u201d\n\nLin Xiaowan said earnestly, \u201cActually, I really know how to cook. It\u2019s just that the food I make isn\u2019t very delicious or professional.\u201d\nFor ordinary people, they would cut vegetables and meat at will. Most people would not care if they were cutting against the grain of the meat or not, and they also would not deliberately learn how to cut cucumbers into diamond-shaped slices.\nThe chef liked Lin Xiaowan\u2019s passion for learning and her indomitable spirit.\nAs such, he was very willing to teach her. He said, \u201cLet me teach you the secret to cutting onions without tearing up\u2026\u201d\nThe chef brought the onions that had been cut in half out of the fridge and said, \u201cAll you have to do is freeze it in advance. With that, your eyes won\u2019t tear up when you cut the onion.\u201d\nGu Yuwu raised her camera and said, \u201cI\u2019ll include this scene in the video later\u2026\u201d\nUpon hearing this, the chef said, \u201cActually, there\u2019s also another way that everyone might be more familiar with. After all, very few people would keep onions in the refrigerator, right?\u201d\nThe chef found a small basin and filled half of it with water. After putting the onions in, he said, \u201cJust cut the onions in water. You have to use a basin that will allow you to cut the onions comfortably. Otherwise, it\u2019ll be troublesome to cut the onions.\u201d\nThe chef cut the onions and continued to say, \u201cLook. This basin is a little small so it\u2019s harder to cut the onions.\nGu Yuwu exclaimed, \u201cWow! It doesn\u2019t look hard for you at all. As expected of a chef.\u201d\nThe chef said, \u201cIf you think this method is a waste of water, there\u2019s another way.\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Lin Xiaowan asked seriously.\n\u201cIf you heat the onions in a microwave, the high temperature would destroy the alliinase in the onions. With that, your eyes won\u2019t tear up when you\u2019re cutting them.\u201d\nThe chef continued, \u201cThere might be people who don\u2019t have microwaves at home. They can choose the other methods instead.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan\u2019s eyes sparkled as she exclaimed, \u201cWow! You\u2019re really knowledgeable!\u201d\nThe chef did not think too much of it and said modestly, \u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal. I\u2019m a chef, after all. It\u2019s natural to know these small things. The majority of chefs know these things as well.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan rubbed her hands together and said excitedly, \u201cI\u2019m going to learn from you whenever 1 have time in the future! I\u2019ll help you!\u201d\nThe chef paused for a moment before he said tactfully, \u201cThere\u2019s no need to trouble Miss Lin to help me.\u201d\nGu Yuwu laughed when she heard the underlying meaning of the chef\u2019s words.\n\u201cAlright then,\u201d Lin Xiaowan said. This was the first time she discovered that the chef who came to cook every day was a little humorous..\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

The two young women insisted on doing it themselves so she could only watch them. She held the camera, not daring to move as she said anxiously, \u201cWait. Wait for the pot to heat up! Don\u2019t put cold water on it! That sauce has to be mixed again!\u201d\nLin Xiaowan filled the takeout boxes with desserts. She had a lot of beautiful takeout boxes now that she was going to open up a dessert shop. She said with a smile, \u201cAunt Wu, you\u2019re too anxious.\u201d\nIt was not even 10 AM when Huo Zheng came downstairs.\nQin Yanchuan whistled when he saw Huo Zheng and said, \u201cOh, you\u2019re finally willing to remove your suit? 1 thought it was glued to your body!\u201d\nLin Xiaowan helped Huo Zheng pick out the clothes he wore today. He wore a white shirt, a windbreaker, and a pair of casual pants. As for the shoes, he wore the couple\u2019s shoes she bought previously. The outfit softened his aura greatly.\nAt this moment, Lin Xiaowan ran over and lifted her foot slightly before she said proudly, \u201cLook at our shoes!\u201d\nAt the same time, Gu Yuwu stepped forward and covered Qin Yanchuan\u2019s eyes as she said, \u201c1 don\u2019t dare to let Yanchuan see this.\u201d\nGu Yuwu and Qin Yanchuan had never worn matching items before. She knew Qin Yanchuan was the king of jealousy, and if he saw Lin Xiaowan and Gu Yuwu\u2019s shoes, she did not know how he would kick up a fuss.\nQin Yanchuan was not stupid nor was he blind. The couple in front of him was standing together, and their shoes could not be more obvious. He felt a little envious, and he called out, \u201cBaby, I\u2026\u201d\nGu Yuwu\u2019s expression changed and she said through gritted teeth, \u201cCan you speak properly?\u201d\nGu Yuwu did not know where Qin Yanchuan learned it from. He did not call her by her name and would keep calling her \u2018baby\u2019 day in and day out.\nQin Yanchuan was a prominent figure. In front of others, he was stern and aloof, but he was completely different when he was with his wife. He said, \u201cNo.\n1 want to call you \u2018baby*. Baby, Baby, Baby\u2026\u201d\nThen, Qin Yanchuan continued to say with an aggrieved expression on his face, \u201cLook, they\u2019re wearing matching shoes! I want to wear matching items as well!\u201d\nLin Xiaowan was at a loss. Suddenly, a small light bulb lit up in her mind, and she said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t I remove my shoes, and you can wear them?\u201d\n\nH ii\nGu Yuwu said with a smile, \u201cIt\u2019s fine. There\u2019s no need for that.\u201d\nHuo Zheng was speechless. Then, he looked at Qin Yanchuan with a complicated gaze, his meaning was very obvious.\nUpon seeing this, Qin Yanchuan said unhappily, \u201cWhat\u2019s with that look? Do you think 1 want to wear matching shoes with you?!\u201d\nThe group of four drove to the western suburbs on their own and did not call for a driver. Excluding Lin Xiaowan, all of them knew how to drive.\nIt took less than two hours to drive to the farmhouse in the western suburbs. When they arrived, it was just in time for lunch.\nThe farm was beautiful, and the house was gorgeous. At the entrance, there was a map of the farm on a block of stone.\nBehind the house, there was a quiet bamboo forest. After walking past the bamboo forest and turning right, one would see the lake. A narrow red wooden bridge with a small and exquisite pavilion at the end of it extended to the heart of the lake. On both sides of the narrow bridge were clusters of white water primrose.\nOn the left of the bamboo forest, there was a hot spring. However, since it was summer now, none of them was interested in soaking in the hot spring.\nThe caretaker of the farm had already set up everything for them. There were all kinds of things like a barbecue stove, karaoke machine with sound systems, fishing rods, baskets, and the likes.\nHuo Zheng poured some warm water for Lin Xiaowan and said, \u201cDrink some water.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan\u2019s cup was very cute. It was one of those straw cups that was very popular among kids. Her cup was very big and could hold a liter of water.\nAfter drinking water, Lin Xiaowan ran to the side to fiddle with the karaoke machine with Gu Yuwu.\nIt did not take long before Huo Zheng brought a plate of fruits over. He knew that Lin Xiaowan wanted to eat snacks, but if she ate snacks now, she would ruin her appetite for lunch.\nAs expected, Lin Xiaowan said, \u201c1 want to eat that chocolate oatmeal cake.\u201d\n\u201cEat some fruits first.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan knew that Huo Zheng would not allow her to eat the cake now so she said, \u201cAlright.\u201d\n\u201cYou can have some yogurt.\u201d\nAfter Huo Zheng fed her a cherry, she shook her head and said, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to.\u201d\n\nThe yogurt was homemade. There was very little sugar added, and it was a little sour.\nLin Xiaowan had been eating a lot of desserts recently. It was not too long ago that she had a toothache. After seeing the dentist, he had told her to cut down on her sugar consumption.\nAt this time, Gu Yuwu took photos conscientiously. At the same time, she clicked her tongue and said in admiration, \u201cSee how caring this kind of boyfriend is?\u201d\nUnwilling to be left out, Qin Yanchuan tried to attract his wife\u2019s attention. He said loudly, \u201cI want to eat chocolate oatmeal cake too!\u201d\nGu Yuwu rolled her eyes and said, \u201cWe have a lot of meat. Eat the meat!\u201d\nYesterday, the chef had prepared a lot of meat skewers for them. Those that were marinated with spicy sauce were packed separately. There were also vegetables. There was a lot of food that they could eat to their hearts\u2019 content.\nWhile the men barbecued the meat, Lin Xiaowan, who lost interest in the karaoke machine, wanted to go fishing. Seeing how eager she was, Gu Yuwu volunteered to teach her.\nHowever, Gu Yuwu herself did not have much experience. She knew they had to prepare the bait and such. Previously everything had been prepared for her, all she needed to do was to hold the rod and wait for the fish to take the bait.\nThe two young women crouched down and watched a tutorial video.\nAfter a while, Lin Xiaowan, who was watching the video, suddenly said, \u201cI want to eat roasted potatoes!\u201d\nGu Yuwu was stunned by the abrupt change in topic. After a moment, she said, \u201cI don\u2019t think we brought any. I\u2019ll call the caretaker to ask.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan nodded. After that, she rolled up her sleeves and touched the bait. After a moment, she said seriously, \u201cIt looks like meatballs. The color and feel are quite similar\u2026\u201d\nGu Yuwu laughed. \u201cAre you very hungry?\u201d\nCoincidentally, a gust of wind brought the fragrance of roasted meat over. It was as though an invisible hand had reached out and turned Lin Xiaowan\u2019s head to the source of the fragrance.\nHuo Zheng was very meticulous with everything he did. Perhaps it was due to his elegant and noble temperament, although he was just grilling mushrooms, he looked as though he was conducting some amazing experiment.\nLin Xiaowan sniffed a few times before she said, \u201cIt smells so good\u2026\u201d\nThe two young women quickly grew bored of fishing. After throwing the bait into the lake, they waited. After sitting for a while, there were still no movements, and Lin Xiaowan began to yawn, looking drowsy.\nLin Xiaowan ate from the plate of fruit, ignoring her fishing rod. At the same time, she would also feed Gu Yuwu.\nGu Yuwu was amused by Lin Xiaowan.. She said, \u201cWe haven\u2019t eaten yet, but you\u2019re already sleepy?\u201d\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

Apart from that, there were also exotic flowers that were grown in a huge glass greenhouse. There were rocking chairs and tables in the greenhouse for resting as well. There was also a box with many things inside to help one pass the time.\nLin Xiaowan had brought her sketchbook and her pencil when she came out today. She sat cross-legged to sketch while Gu Yuwu lay on the hammock. This was the homework that Hong Minhua had given her; Hong Minhua wanted her to complete three sketches. Although she was not very good at drawing, this homework was not difficult for her.\nThey had plenty of time now. They planned to hike the famous Mount An in the neighboring city. However, they were only going to hike at night. It would take five hours to hike to the peak to watch the sunrise. As such, they were not in a rush.\nIn the evening, the few of them went to the beach. The waves gradually receded from the show, and the surface of the sea reflected the colors of the fiery sunset. Even the clouds were tinted with the fiery hues. All in all, it was very beautiful.\nLin Xiaowan stood barefooted on the wet sand.\nUpon seeing this, Huo Zheng picked up her shoes and said, \u201cBe careful of your feet. Don\u2019t get cut by sharp stones.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan\u2019s skin was very delicate. With just a little force, it would leave a red mark. It was very easy for her to cut her skin and get injured.\nLin Xiaowan carried a small bucket and chased after the retreating waves as she replied, \u201cThat won\u2019t happen!\u201d\nGu Yuwu picked up a small crab and showed it to Lin Xiaowan, saying, \u201cLook. It\u2019s still spitting out bubbles.\u201d\nThe crab was really small, only the size of a thumb. It was playing dead on Gu Yuwu\u2019s palm, looking lifeless.\nLin Xiaowan poked it and asked, \u201cCan this be eaten?\u201d\nGu Yuwu casually released the crab back into the shallow water and said, \u201cThere\u2019s no meaning in eating such a small crab\u2026 Why do you always think of food when looking at things?\u201d\n\nAfter that, Gu Yuwu added, \u201cYou\u2019re not picky with food as well. You\u2019re really easy to raise.\u201d\nEarlier in the afternoon, the caretaker at the farm had brought a small basket of sweet potatoes. They were very small and were a variety that was developed by some agricultural institute. There were ten of them in the basket, and Lin Xiaowan alone ate half of them enthusiastically.\nLin Xiaowan said defensively, \u201cThat\u2019s not true\u2026\u201d\nGoing to the beach was not part of the plan. They were making their way to Mount An when they passed a small section of the coast. As the sun was setting, they stopped the car to have a look. They also bought a small bucket. Since the tide was receding, perhaps they could find things on the beach. Many marine creatures would also be stranded on the beach because they could not keep up with the retreating speed of the tide.\nLin Xiaowan picked up a handful of seashells and placed them in the plastic bucket.\nGu Yuwu could tell that Lin Xiaowan liked seashells very much so she suggested, \u201cLet\u2019s go to that shop later. They can turn the seashells into anything you want such as necklaces, bracelets, and the like\u2026\u201d\nLin Xiaowan nodded. \u201cThat sounds great. However, will they be able to send it to me?\u201d\nOtherwise, it would be too troublesome to return to this place to collect the item. After all, they were no longer in Shengjing City\u2019s territory. It was quite a distance away from Shengjing.\n\u201cYes.\u201d\nThe weather in June was not like midsummer. After sunset, the sky would still be bright for a long time in midsummer. Now, the sky would turn dark as soon as the sun set.\nLin Xiaowan carefully selected a few small seashells and took them to the shop to turn them into earrings.\nThere was one that was especially beautiful. Its teeth were white with a green-black grain. It looked like it was glowing when the light shone on it. The patterns were exquisite as well, and the edges were round and smooth. Lin Xiaowan waited for it to be polished before taking it away. She wanted to make a brooch or cufflinks for Huo Zheng without it. Cufflinks usually came in pairs so she was not sure if the shell could be cut into two.\nWhen Gu Yuwu saw Lin Xiaowan carefully putting the shell in the innermost part of her bag, she asked curiously, \u201cAre you bringing this one back as a souvenir? It\u2019s pretty.\u201d\nAlthough the seashell was very pretty, it did not seem like it would make a good decorative piece due to its size.\nLin Xiaowan looked around before she leaned over and whispered into Gu Yuwu\u2019s ear, \u201cDo you know any designers?\u201d\n\u201cWhat kind of designer?\u201d\n\n\u201cA jewelry designer. I want to make a brooch out of this seashell.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s so special about this seashell?\u201d Gu Yuwu asked before adding, \u201cIf you like brooches, I\u2019ll bring you to buy them in the future.\u201d\nAt this time, they had already gotten into the car. Lin Xiaowan looked at the two men who were talking in the front seats. Seeing that they were not paying attention, she explained to Gu Yuwu, \u201cNo. I want to give it to Huo Zheng.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan rarely gave Huo Zheng anything. After all, his starting point was too high, and she did not know what to give him. Huo Zheng did not seem to like anything, and he also did not seem to have preferences. After thinking about it, it seemed to her that he did not have any hobbies as well. Most men in their late twenties like playing football and such, but Huo Zheng seemed to either be working or spending his time with her.\nLin Xiaowan said, \u201c1 think it\u2019s too plain as well. I wonder if gemstones could be embedded on it\u2026\u201d\nHowever, the gemstones that could match Huo Zheng\u2019s status were all expensive. Hence, Lin Xiaowan was not very sure about this idea.\nUpon hearing those words, Gu Yuwu asked, \u201cDo you have a budget?\u201d\nEven without the cost of the raw materials, the fee for the craftsmanship of a well-known jewelry designer was not to be underestimated.\nLin Xiaowan shook her head nervously. \u201cIs it very expensive?\u201d\nGu Yuwu thought about the price based on her experience before she said, \u201cIt\u2019s not expensive for the Huo family, but\u2026 it might be quite expensive for you. I\u2019ll ask around for you when we get back.\u201d\nIn fact, Lin Xiaowan could also look for lesser-known jewelry designers in the industry. There were many young designers who were talented as well. It was just that they had not gotten a break yet.\nThere were quite many people who came to climb Mount An at night. After all, it was Friday. About 90% of them were young people, and they looked like university students. Apart from that, there were families with the elderly and children, some even brought their pets. Everyone was talking and laughing.\nLin Xiaowan bought two glowing bunny ears clips. After she and Gu Yuwu put it on, they leaned their heads close to each other, and she took a photo with Gu Yuwu\u2019s phone.\nGu Yuwu edited the photo a little before she asked Lin Xiaowan, \u201cCan I post this on my social media?\u201d\nGu Yuwu\u2019s photography skills were good, and her editing skills were also good. Li Xiaowan really liked Gu Yuwu\u2019s style of photography the moment she saw it. The photo was taken beautifully and was only shared among close friends so Lin Xiaowan did not mind and nodded.\nThe two young women walked side by side as they climbed up the mountain.\nMeanwhile, Huo Zheng carried her bag and her water bottle for her. Lin Xiaowan wanted to carry the water bottle, but it was rather heavy since it was still filled with water. For this reason, Huo Zheng sized her up for a moment before he said, \u201cLet me do it.\u201d\nAlthough he did not say anything, the meaning of his gaze was obvious to Lin Xiaowan. Seeing how proactive he was as a boyfriend, she did not refuse and said as she gestured with her hands, \u201cAlright, alright, you can do it, you can do it..\u201d\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

It was already close to midnight when they began their hike. However, the liveliness of the people in the surroundings made people forget about the time.\nGu Yuwu took a few photos before she stuffed her camera in her back. After that, she stuffed her bag into Qin Yanchuan\u2019s hands and patted him on the head as she said, \u201cDon\u2019t fall too far behind. 1\u201911 take more photos after we\u2019ve walked for a bit.\u201d\nQin Yanchuan hugged her and kissed her before he said, \u201cAre you looking down on your husband? 1 hold the record of carrying your things for more than ten kilometers!\u201d\nMount An was not very high in altitude, but Lin Xiaowan\u2019s stamina was really poor. In the beginning, she could still stride forward valiantly, but it did not take long before her legs started aching.\nIn the beginning, there was a long slope, and it was easy to walk. However, strictly speaking, this part of the journey could not be considered climbing the mountain.\nAfter walking for ten minutes and climbing a few steps, the path suddenly became narrow. Next to the street lamp, there was a blue street sign.\n[Congratulations on reaching the starting point. There are still 6,217 steps waiting for you!]\nLin Xiaowan\u2019s eyes widened in disbelief as she exclaimed, \u201cIf this is the starting point, then what was it before? The road to the starting point?\u201d\nHuo Zheng handed Lin Xiaowan her water bottle so she could have a drink as he asked, \u201cTired?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan took two sips and conveniently hung the water bottle around her neck. She stretched her arms and legs as she said, \u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d\nAfter a moment, she added, \u201cSix thousand steps don\u2019t seem like a lot\u2026 How high is the mountain?\u201d\n\u201cThe mountain is not very high. It\u2019s not very steep, and it\u2019s not dangerous\u2026\u201d\n\nLin Xiaowan\u2019s fighting spirit was reignited after hearing this, and she said, \u201cAlright! Let\u2019s go!\u201d\nHuo Zheng reached out and said, \u201cWater bottle.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan did not give it to him. \u201cI can carry it. It\u2019s more convenient this way.\u201d\nHuo Zheng did not insist this time. However, he kept an eye on her. As she walked the bottle would sway, and the strap would rub against her neck. It did not take long before a light red mark appeared at the back and sides of her neck. He was walking behind her so he saw everything clearly when they passed by the street lamps. After holding it in for a long time and seeing how uncomfortable she was, he could not help but take the water bottle from her.\nLin Xiaowan was puzzled. After all, it was just a water bottle. It was not hard to carry it. Nonetheless, she had to admit that it was more comfortable after he took the water bottle from her.\nAfter more than an hour of walking and stopping, Lin Xiaowan felt that she could not move anymore. She was shocked when she discovered that among the four of them, she was the only one who was tired. The other three looked very relaxed.\n\u2018How can this be?!\u2019\nThe further they went up, they saw that apart from one or two peddlers at the designated areas, there were only the steps and the hikers. There were no more street lamps as well. Apart from the moonlight, the only source of light was the flashlight in the hikers\u2019 hands.\nLin Xiaowan rested for two minutes before she looked at her current location on her phone. She almost fainted when she saw that she was still very close to the starting point. She had walked for more than an hour, but she had only advanced less than one centimeter on the mobile map.\n\u2018No, this map is definitely inaccurate!\u2019\n\u201cAre you tired?\u201d\nUpon hearing this, some kind of hidden energy surged up in Lin Xiaowan\u2019s body. She raised her head, unwilling to admit defeat as she said loudly, \u201cI\u2019m not tired! 1 can do it!\u201d\nGu Yuwu said, \u201cIt\u2019s okay. If you can\u2019t walk anymore, we can take a car up there.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan was slightly tempted, but she quickly insisted she was not tired again. They had already started climbing. If she took a car now, she would feel as though she had climbed in vain so far. However, she also felt that the speed of climbing the mountain was very slow. Every time they took a break, she was the only one panting and gasping for breath. The other three also took care of her and accompanied her when she rested.\nLin Xiaowan felt a little apologetic for delaying the others so she said, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to wait for me. You can go ahead first, and I\u2019ll catch up to you.\u201d\nHuo Zheng only looked at her silently as he helped her tidy up her air.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t say that,\u201d Gu Yuwu said with a smile, \u201cOur main goal is to watch the sunrise, not climb the mountain. Climbing the mountain is just part of the journey. Riding the car up the mountain is also an experience. Moreover, 1 haven\u2019t seen the mountain road at night.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan was not very keen about taking a car up the mountain. They had been hiking in the dark so she assumed that there would be no street lamps if they drove up as well. She thought it would be dangerous driving without any street lamps to light their way. She did not notice that the path up the mountain for cars had street lamps when they passed by earlier.\nLin Xiaowan tried to reduce the time she took to rest and gritted her teeth as she continued to climb up silently. She was originally wearing a thin coat, but because it was too hot, she tried to remove it a few times. However, Huo Zheng kept stopping her. She naturally felt a little unhappy.\nIt was June now. The weather was good during the day, but at night, the mountain wind was cold.\nLin Xiaowan wore a long-sleeved shirt and a pair of pants. She felt that her clothes were sweaty and sticking to her skin, making her feel uncomfortable. She looked at the three people with a hint of admiration. They could even chat while they climbed the stairs. On the contrary, she felt as though she did not have enough oxygen. She really wished she could just lie on the ground and close her eyes at this moment.\nGu Yuwu held Lin Xiaowan\u2019s hand and cheered the latter on. \u201cYou can do it. Let\u2019s sit down and rest up ahead. 1\u201911 buy you an ice cream. Don\u2019t worry about Huo Zheng.\u201d\nHuo Zheng had rejected Lin Xiaowan\u2019s request to have ice cream earlier. He had filled her water bottle with warm water he had gotten from the peddlers earlier. She was naturally unwilling to drink the warm water. She was already feeling hot and sweaty in the first place.\nLin Xiaowan looked up and saw a bustling crowd at the end of the steps where a large resting area was located. After taking a seat, she touched the water bottle. Seeing that the water was no longer warm, she hurriedly drank from the bottle, gulping most of it down.\nHuo Zheng frowned. However, seeing that she was ignoring him, he did not say anything. He waited for her to finish drinking before he filled half of the bottle with hot water.\nLin Xiaowan was so tired at this moment that she did not even bother to protest at this moment.\nGu Yuwu returned after buying a bowl of creamy and fruity shaved ice and sat next to Lin Xiaowan. Seeing that Lin Xiaowan was as angry as a pufferfish, she said with a smile, \u201cAre you still angry at Huo Zheng? Don\u2019t be angry. Let\u2019s eat something to relieve your anger.\u201d\nIt was now past 3 AM, and they were already almost at the halfway point. There was still plenty of time left.\nLin Xiaowan wanted to eat, but she was worried that it was too cold. She looked a little pitiful as she scooped small bites and waited for them to melt a little before she ate them.\nGu Yuwu did not care about these things. She often ate whatever she liked, and she never had any problems. Nonetheless, she was still worried about Lin Xiaowan and did not dare to let the latter eat too much. She said, \u201cJust eat a little, okay?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan was very easygoing. She nodded, looking satisfied.\nGu Yuwu was in fact about the same age as Lin Xiaowan. However, the former spoke and acted like an elder sister. As for Lin Xiaowan, whether it was her temperament or anything else, she appeared much more childish. Moreover, it seemed like the older she got, the more childish she became. Her lost childhood seemed to return after she grew up and was in her twenties. Time seemed to be going backward for her. While others grew up, she seemed to be going back in time..\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

It did not fit his image at all. Although he still looked unapproachable, he did not have his icy aura when he was working. When he returned, he saw a huge bowl of shaved ice on the table. He paused in steps and stared at Lin Xiaowan.\nLin Xiaowan lowered her head and bit her spoon, feeling inexplicably guilty and irritated.\nUpon seeing this, Gu Yuwu said, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be so strict. She only had a few small bites to satisfy her cravings.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan scooped another spoonful and slowly savored it. Her head remained lowered. Although she could feel the burning gaze on her, she ignored it and did not look at him. She was still angry after all. At this moment, her gaze landed on her shoes; her shoelaces had come undone at some point. She stared at it for a moment, feeling a little lazy to bend down and retie them. She was exhausted to begin with, and just the thought of bending down made her feel even more exhausted.\nHuo Zheng noticed this as well. He walked over and crouched down in front of her before he silently tied her shoelaces.\nAlthough no one was paying attention to them, Lin Xiaowan still felt a little embarrassed. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\nHuo Zheng held her ankle carefully as he tied her shoelaces. He looked up at her, her figure clearly reflected in his eyes, as he said, \u201cDon\u2019t be angry with me.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan withdrew her leg and said with a scoff. \u201cI\u2019m not angry at you.\u201d\nHuo Zheng rose to his feet and sat next to her before he asked, \u201cThen why don\u2019t you talk to me?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t feel like talking to you.\u201d\nSeeing that Lin Xiaowan did not seem very angry, Huo Zheng relaxed. He said with a chuckle, \u201cDoesn\u2019t that mean you\u2019re angry with me?\u201d\nHuo Zheng watched her continue to eat the shaved ice bit by bit, and he could not help but say, \u201cEat less.\u201d\nHe was worried Lin Xiaowan would feel unwell after drinking cold water and eating shaved ice after exercising. It would be difficult to seek medical treatment on the mountain, after all.\n\nMeanwhile, Gu Yuwu, who had been watching the amount that Lin Xiaowan ate, finally pulled the bowl in front of her. She said, \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll eat the rest.\u201d Although Lin Xiaowan was reluctant, she did not protest. She was not greedy, and she knew her limit. It was okay now that her cravings were satisfied. She watched Gu Yuwu eat. In just a few bites, the latter had already finished almost half of it. She felt her teeth ache when she watched Gu Yuwu eat.\nThe group rested for nearly 30 minutes. Lin Xiaowan felt rather embarrassed. She felt that if she continued to sit and lean against Huo Zheng like this, she would not want to leave for the rest of the night. In the end, she forced herself to continue the journey.\nLin Xiaowan soldiered on to the Sky Gazing Gate. After passing the Sky Gazing Gate, it would be the final stretch to their destination to watch the sunset. Unfortunately, this path was difficult to walk on. The stairs were high and steep. Every step was almost knee-high so one would have to raise their legs very often.\nLin Xiaowan found it difficult to climb up. Seeing this, Huo Zheng carried her up the final steps. Initially, she was unwilling. However, when she discovered that Huo Zheng was only breathing a little heavily after carrying her, she felt much more at ease. At the same time, she also secretly made up her mind to exercise more after she returned.\nAs they climbed higher, the temperature would drop. Although they did not need thick coats like in autumn and winter, they needed a light jacket to keep warm.\nLin Xiaowan was wrapped up in her jacket as she lay on Huo Zheng\u2019s back. She leaned against his head and asked, \u201cAre you cold?\u201d\nHuo Zheng was not wearing a jacket at all. His movements were agile, and his footsteps were steady as he carried her. He replied in a low voice, \u201cI\u2019m not cold.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan hugged his neck tightly and yawned, rubbing against him like a cat.\nHuo Zheng tilted his head to look at her before he said, \u201cIf you\u2019re sleepy, then go to sleep.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan rubbed her eyes drowsily. Since earlier, she had wished to lie on the ground and closed her eyes. Her eyelids felt heavy, and her body was tired. However, now that she was lying on his back, she was not very willing to go to sleep. She said softly, \u201cI\u2019m not sleepy.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s still some time left before the sun rises\u2026\u201d\nThe sun rose relatively late at this time. Although the sky was already beginning to brighten, it would still take a while for the sun to rise.\nAfter going up another flight of stairs, Lin Xiaowan wanted to get off Huo Zheng\u2019s back. There were many people climbing up. Many elderly people relied on their walking sticks to climb up, and even children were climbing up on their own, using their hands and feet. She was the only one who was being carried up, which attracted many people\u2019s attention.\nLin Xiaowan felt embarrassed and shameless. Even if Huo Zheng did not show it, he must be tired. Even if she was not very tall and was very thin, she was still an adult after all.\nSensing Lin Xiaowan\u2019s restlessness, Huo Zheng did not stop moving. He only asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\nSince they were on the stairs, Lin Xiaowan did not dare to struggle, afraid that they would fall. She only said, \u201cI\u2019m not tired anymore. Let me down. I can walk on my own.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re arriving soon.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan said, \u201cSince we\u2019re arriving soon, let me walk. I can\u2019t let you carry me when even children are climbing up on their own.\u201d\nHuo Zheng chuckled softly and asked, \u201cAre you worried that 1\u201911 be tired?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan pouted. \u201cNo.\u201d\nAlthough that was the case, Lin Xiaowan did not want to say it out loud.\nMeanwhile, Gu Yuwu and Qin Yanchuan moved very quickly. They were already waiting for the two at the finish line.\nQin Yanchuan put a jacket on his wife and crouched down to massage her calves enthusiastically. He asked, \u201cHoney, are you tired? Shall we sit for a while? Why don\u2019t you let me carry you? Look at Huo Zheng carrying his wife.\u201d Gu Yuwu really could not understand her husband. \u201cWhat\u2019s there to compare? Xiaowan is a little weaker so she needs to be carried, but I\u2019m not tired at all.\u201d\nGu Yuwu and Qin Yanchuan had grown up together. He knew that she was very athletic and exercised a lot since she was young. As such, she was rather strong.\nQin Yanchuan hugged his wife and rested his head on her shoulder, complaining. In any case, he was envious of Huo Zheng.\nGu Yuwu rubbed Qin Yanchuan\u2019s head, amused. \u201cDon\u2019t look so depressed.\u201d\n\u2018This man is really two-faced. When he\u2019s at work, he\u2019s really ruthless. However, he acts coquettish in front of me all of the time\u2026 He really doesn\u2019t act like the head of the Office of Military and Political Affairs in front of me\u2026\u2019\nGu Yuwu brought her camera out and began to take photos again.\nIn the distance, a tall man turned his head slightly to the side, attentively listening to what the person on his back was saying. His expression was serious and gentle as the woman on his back whispered something to him. Her face was slightly red, and her expression was slightly helpless.\nIn the end, Huo Zheng carried Lin Xiaowan all the way up. He only put her down when they reached the last step of the flight of stairs. Then, he held her hand and supported her as she took the last step. This was because she had insisted on taking the last step. She said that she would feel a sense of accomplishment by doing so.\nHuo Zheng did not comment on her words and only supported her to climb the last step.\nAt this moment, Gu Yuwu said, \u201cI just took a photo of both of you. Have a look..\u201d\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

The area near the cliff was extremely crowded so they found another place, which was less windy, in the end.\nAfter waiting for a moment, the sun was finally rising in the east. At first, the sun was still hidden in the thick clouds, only radiating a soft red light.\nEveryone raised their cameras at the same time, waiting for the perfect moment to capture the scenery.\nLin Xiaowan did not know how to take photos. She stood next to the two men, who were of no help, before she shuffled over to Gu Yuwu\u2019s side.\nThe sun rose very quickly. The red light grew brighter and brighter as a small ball of flame gradually came out from behind the clouds. It was dazzling and eye-catching.\nHuddled in Huo Zheng\u2019s embrace, Lin Xiaowan watched the sunrise, completely entranced by the sight. This was the first time she had seen the sun from such a high altitude. Although Mount An was not very tall, she still had the illusory feeling of standing above the clouds at this moment. Looking at the sunrise from here felt as though she was watching the sun being born from the ground.\n\u201cHave you seen the sunrise from the top of a mountain before?\u201d Lin Xiaowan asked Huo Zheng.\n\u201cYes.\u201d\nWhen Huo Zheng was in school, his class would often have activities for the students. Although he was not very interested in those activities, Song Zhiyi liked them. As such, he would often accompany her.\n\u201cOh,\u201d Lin Xiaowan replied. She knew what was going on and did not ask any more questions.\nIn just a moment, the sun hung high in the sky, returning to the appearance that everyone was familiar with.\nHuo Zheng raised his hand and gently stroked Lin Xiaowan\u2019s cheek with his index finger as he said in a low voice, \u201c1 like you.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan looked up at him and smiled. \u201cI like you too.\u201d\nOut of the three assignments that Hong Minhua gave Lin Xiaowan, she only completed two. The last one was drawn based on her memory after she returned from watching the sunrise. It was also the piece that was praised by Hong Minhua.\n\u201cDon\u2019t you think this one is different from all your other works?\u201d Hong Minhua asked.\n\u201cNo. How is it different?\u201d Lin Xiaowan asked, puzzled.\n\u201cYou have to go out and sightsee more,\u201d Hong Minhua said.\n\nLin Xiaowan understood Hong Minhua\u2019s meaning.\nAfter returning from Mount An, Lin Xiaowan also came up with a training plan. She wrote her plan down on a whiteboard and even decorated it with cute doodles.\nHuo Zheng took a look and said skeptically, \u201cWake up at 6 AM? Running from 6.15 AM to 7 AM?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan usually woke up at 7.30 AM. Even then, when Huo Zheng urged her to wash up, she could hardly open her eyes and would grumble unhappily, still groggy. If Huo Zheng had a meeting and left early, she would laze in bed until about 8.30 AM before the nanny woke her up.\nNo matter how Huo Zheng thought about it, he did not think the plan was going to be a success.\nLin Xiaowan pointed at the schedule and said weakly, \u201cThere are postscripts.\u201d\nHuo Zheng looked at the postscripts, and he found them amusing. \u201cSo you\u2019re going to walk instead of run?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Lin Xiaowan explained, \u201cI haven\u2019t run in a long time. When I was in school, 1 even failed the 800-meter run. Since I\u2019m just starting, 1 can\u2019t make things too difficult for myself.\u201d\nApart from running, Lin Xiaowan also planned to do a few fitness exercises and stretching exercises before bed. Her schedule was rather packed.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to run to exercise. You can do other things as well,\u201d Huo Zheng said.\nLin Xiaowan did not exercise at all prior to this. She would not be able to endure it if she started with such a high-intensity plan.\n\u201cI went to the gym to have a look. I saw the spin bike. It looks interesting,\u201d Lin Xiaowan said.\nHuo Zheng was usually the only one who used the gym. The housekeeper would go in once in a while to clean it. As for Lin Xiaowan, she had always stayed as far away as she could from the gym. She only went there today to have a look before making her training plan.\nThere was some basic equipment inside such as a treadmill, a spin bike, and dumbbells. These were also the only things she recognized. She was unfamiliar with the other things there.\n\u201cSo I\u2019ll wake you up tomorrow morning?\u201d Huo Zheng asked.\nHuo Zheng did not usually wake up at 6 AM; he usually woke up at about 6.30 AM. He would exercise for a while, shower, and change his clothes before he woke Lin Xiaowan up for breakfast.\nLin Xiaowan agreed without thinking too much about it.\nDespite Lin Xiaowan\u2019s enthusiasm, she could not wake up the next morning at 6 AM.\nThe curtains were drawn in the bedroom. It was not bright yet so the lamp in the room was lit.\nHuo Zheng called out to her a few times, but she only burrowed herself deeper into the blanket. In the end, she simply covered her head with the blanket.\n\nAmused, Huo Zheng pulled the blanket down gently and asked, \u201cDidn\u2019t you say you were going to wake up early and run?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan remembered that she planned to wake up at 6 AM to exercise today. However, she really could not open her eyes now, let alone lift the blanket off her body. In the end, she said reluctantly, \u201cLet me sleep for another five minutes. I\u2019ll get up after that.\u201d\nHowever, after five minutes passed, Lin Xiaowan wanted to sleep for another five minutes. Huo Zheng tried to wake her up with great difficulty two more times before he kissed her and said, \u201cGo to sleep. You can start your plan tomorrow.\u201d\nHowever, Lin Xiaowan was not very willing to give up completely. She muttered, \u201cI\u2019ll do it later.\u201d\nHuo Zheng no longer disturbed her sweet dreams. He turned off the alarm clock she had set and tiptoed out of the room.\nHowever, after he left, Lin Xiaowan found it hard to fall asleep. She closed her eyes and lay in bed for a long time, but she still could not fall asleep. After a while, she hugged the blanket and sat up. It seemed like once Huo Zheng was not around, she could not fall asleep for some reason.\nBefore Huo Zheng left, he had switched off the bedside light. At this time, the only light in the room came from the balcony.\nLin Xiaowan grabbed her phone and checked the time. It was 6.23 AM. It was still very early. In the end, she resigned herself to her fate and got up.\nHuo Zheng was surprised when he saw her entering the gym.\n\u201cWhy are you up?\u201d\nNaturally, Lin Xiaowan did not say that she could not fall asleep after he left. Instead, she said proudly, \u201cI said I would get up early.\u201d\nHuo Zheng laughed before he taught her how to warm up first.\nLin Xiaowan was very interested in the spin bike so he let her use it after warming up.\nThe spin bike looked unassuming, but Lin Xiaowan soon realized that it was not as easy as it looked. After all, if it was easy, it would not count as fitness equipment.\nLin Xiaowan cycled for just a while before she slowed down and gradually stopped completely. She sat there and watched Huo Zheng do pull-ups.\n\u201cWhy are you staring at me?\u201d Huo Zheng asked.\n\u201cYou\u2019re handsome.\u201d\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you say you were going to exercise?\u201d Huo Zheng asked with a hint of helplessness.\nAfter doing a few sets of pull-ups, Huo Zheng waved Lin Xiaowan over to the treadmill.\nLin Xiaowan asked, \u201cCan we adjust the speed? What\u2019s the slowest speed? Can I walk?\u201d\n\u201cYes. Give it a try?\u201d Huo Zheng said as he helped her get on the treadmill and adjusted the speed for her..\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

He found her on the couch, looking as though she was going to fall asleep. When Lin Xiaowan saw him approaching, she continued to lie on the couch, looking boneless, as she reached for him.\n\u201cHug.\u201d\nHuo Zheng hugged her before he carried her up. He supported her back and bottom with his hands to prevent her from falling. Although the dining room was not far at all, she had fallen asleep in his arms when they arrived.\n\u201cWhy is she so sleepy today?\u201d Aunt Wu asked, puzzled.\nAlthough Lin Xiaowan had a hard time getting up early in the morning, she had never been carried to the dining room half asleep.\nAunt Wu looked at the time and found that it was still rather early.\nHuo Zheng patted Lin Xiaowan\u2019s face gently to wake her up.\nWhen Lin Xiaowan opened her eyes, she found that she was already in the dining room. She quickly sobered up and got out of Huo Zheng\u2019s embrace before she took a seat, sitting upright.\nUpon seeing this, Aunt Wu laughed and teased her, making her feel embarrassed.\nAfter breakfast, Lin Xiaowan waited for Huo Zheng to leave before she went to the studio to draw and paint. However, she began to yawn as soon as she sat down.\n\u2018It hasn\u2019t even been two minutes since I got here\u2026 This won\u2019t do\u2026 How can 1 produce good work if I\u2019m not in a good state?\u2019 Lin Xiaowan thought to herself, justifying her decision before going back to bed.\nAt night.\nLin Xiaowan sat on the bed. When she saw Huo Zheng, she said with a straight face, \u201c1 don\u2019t think the training plan is very well thought out\u2026\u201d\nHuo Zheng looked at her with a hint of amusement in his eyes as she erased her plan on the whiteboard.\nShe had already experienced the pain of waking up early. If she had to wake up early every day, she would only suffer.\n\u201cI\u2019ll modify the plan later before I continue\u2026\u201d\n\nTwo days later.\nGu Yuwu called Lin Xiaowan and asked, \u201c1\u201911 take you out to experience another sport. What do you think?\u201d\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Lin Xiaowan asked.\n\u201cArchery. Are you interested?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan readily agreed, curious.\nThe venue was located in a club. Apart from archery, there was also a shooting range, a boxing ring, a go-karting track, and the likes. There was also a lake for boating at the back.\nWhen Gu Yuwu led Lin Xiaowan in, Gu Yuwu met many familiar faces.\nOne of them was a young woman who pulled her hair up into a high ponytail. Her skin was good, and her figure was very good. Her expression was indifferent as she raised her hand and nocked the arrows. Even when she released the arrows and hit the bullseye, her expression did not change.\nGu Yuwu smiled and greeted the other party. \u201cWhat a coincidence. 1 didn\u2019t expect to meet the workaholic President Cheng here on a weekday.\u201d\nCheng Ruitong nodded at Gu Yuwu in response. Although her face was expressionless, her voice was gentle as she asked, gesturing at Lin Xiaowan, \u201cThis is?\u201d\n\u201cThis is my sister, Lin Xiaowan. I brought her here to play today.\u201d\nCheng Ruitong studied Lin Xiaowan from top to bottom. A hint of skepticism could be seen in her eyes, but she did not say anything.\nGu Yuwu turned to Lin Xiaowan and said, \u201cCome and say hello to Sister Cheng. She\u2019s the president of Chenghong Technologies, Cheng Ruitong.\u201d\n\u201cHello, President Cheng,\u201d Lin Xiaowan greeted with a smile.\n\u201cHello,\u201d Cheng Ruitong said with a nod, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be so polite. It\u2019s not like we\u2019re at work.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan tilted her head, shifting her gaze from Cheng Ruitong to Gu Yuwu.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no need to dwell on her words. She\u2019s like this to everyone she doesn\u2019t work with. Not only is she good at archery, but she\u2019s also good at riding horses and shooting. If we\u2019re lucky enough to meet her again, 1\u201911 ask her to teach you how to ride.\u201d\n\u2018How impressive!\u2019 Lin Xiaowan thought to herself as her eyes widened.\nCheng Ruitong\u2019s personality is very different from her aloof appearance. She was very casual and friendly even though it was their first meeting. She asked, \u201cIs this your first time here, Xiaowan?\u201d\n\nLin Xiaowan nodded.\n\u201cAre you leaving soon? If you\u2019re not in a hurry, why don\u2019t you teach us the basics of archery?\u201d Gu Yuwu asked.\nCheng Ruitong looked at Gu Yuwu, raising an eyebrow slightly. They were all in the same circle, and she knew Gu Yuwu was not uninitiated in these things. Even if Gu Yuwu was not very skilled, Gu Yuwu was familiar with it. There was no need for her to teach Gu Yuwu the basics.\nAs though she could read Cheng Ruitong\u2019s thoughts, Gu Yuwu added, \u201cWell, I mostly want your help to teach Xiaowan. She\u2019s a complete newbie.\u201d\nCheng Ruitong looked at Lin Xiaowan who was standing obediently at the side. In her eyes, Lin Xiaowan looked very tender, and her facial features were delicate. At this moment, she was looking around curiously. Seeing Lin Xiaowan\u2019s ruddy cheeks, she felt like pinching them to see if they were as soft as they looked.\nFinally, Cheng Ruitong replied, \u201cI\u2019m not in a rush. 1 just arrived not long ago.\u201d\nThen, Chen Ruitong said to Lin Xiaowan, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to address me as President Cheng. You can just call me Sister like Yuwu does.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan was delighted that she had gained another \u2018sister\u2019. She smiled and called out sweetly, \u201cSister Cheng.\u201d\nCheng Ruitong nodded and waved Lin Xiaowan over. \u201cCome here.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan quickly walked over to Cheng Ruitong\u2019s side. When she smelled Cheng Ruitong, she thought of winter. She thought about the snow falling heavily in the morning, opening the door, and seeing a red plum blossom tree standing in the yard. This was the feeling that the latter\u2019s scent evoked.\nCheng Ruitong was extremely tall. She was almost 1.8 meters tall, which was quite rare for women. In comparison, Lin Xiaowan looked even more petite standing next to her.\nWhile Cheng Ruitong taught Lin Xiaowan how to draw the bowstring, Lin Xiaowan could not help but sniff around. Upon seeing this, Cheng Ruitong asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan was a little embarrassed that she had been discovered. She replied sheepishly, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. I just thought that your perfume smells really good. I really like it. Where did you buy it?\u201d\n\u201cMy good friend made it for me. If you like it, I\u2019ll give you a bottle,\u201d Cheng Ruitong replied.\n\u201cNo, no, it\u2019s okay,\u201d Lin Xiaowan hurriedly said. She thought she would buy it herself once Cheng Ruitong told her the brand of the perfume. However, the perfume was especially given to Cheng Ruitong by a good friend, she did not think it was appropriate to accept it. After all, this was only their first meeting, and they were just acquaintances at best.\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine. My friend will be very happy if she knows that someone likes the perfume she made,\u201d Cheng Ruitong said.\n\u201cNo, no, 1 don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea,\u201d Lin Xiaowan said. Although she was very tempted, she felt it was a little inappropriate. After thinking about it for a while, she asked, \u201cDoes your friend sell the perfumes she makes? 1 can buy it.\u201d \u201cShe does, \u201cCheng Ruitong said before she added, \u201cHowever, she doesn\u2019t sell the perfume you like.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan felt a little regretful, but she still asked for the other party\u2019s contact number.\nAlthough Cheng Ruitong looked aloof, she was very patient and helpful.\nUsually, Cheng Ruitong\u2019s friend only sold the perfumes she made to her friends. It was not her main business, and perfumery was just a hobby to her. Cheng Ruitong showed Lin Xiaowan the website. However, the fragrances were all sold out and had to be pre-ordered..\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

She was naturally busy. Before Lin Xiaowan\u2019s arrow could hit the target, Cheng Ruitong received a work call and had to leave.\nLin Xiaowan looked reluctant as she waved at Cheng Ruitong. \u201cGoodbye, Sister Cheng!\u201d\nCheng Ruitong smiled and said, \u201cSee you next time!\u201d\nMeanwhile, Gu Yuwu, who was standing at the side, watched the duo\u2019s interaction. She had seen them exchanging contact details earlier; it was clear that the duo had gotten closer. At this moment, she cleared her throat and asked, \u201cSister Cheng, you didn\u2019t say goodbye to me! I\u2019m still here!\u201d\nCheng Ruitong chuckled and said, \u201cGoodbye, Yuwu.\u201d\nGu Yuwu was just joking with Cheng Ruitong. She said, \u201cAlright, alright, since you\u2019re busy, you better go\u2026\u201d\nAfter Cheng Ruitong left, Gu Yuwu took over and played with Lin Xiaowan.\nLin Xiaowan was very interested, but she was also confused. She asked, \u201cIs this also considered a form of exercise? It\u2019s not tiring at all.\u201d\nPreviously, Lin Xiaowan noticed that Gu Yuwu was not out of breath at all when they climbed Mount An. From the beginning until the end, Gu Yuwu was very relaxed. If she was not present, she felt that Gu Yuwu, Qin Yanchuan, and Huo Zheng would be able to climb to the top without resting. The trio\u2019s stamina was amazing.\nOn the other hand, Lin Xiaowan\u2019s legs were extremely sore after she returned from the hike. Nonetheless, she still gritted her teeth and came up with a training plan. Alas, her training plan failed completely.\nHer sore legs only reminded her of the hard work, but she forgot that hard work was also part of the process.\n\u201cSince we\u2019re only doing this for fun, there\u2019s not much exercise involved,\u201d Gu Yuwu said before asking, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Do you want to exercise?\u201d\n\nLin Xiaowan nodded bitterly. \u201cI feel like I should exercise.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s a good idea. However, you\u2019re a little too thin. Are you usually picky with your food?\u201d\n\u201cNo, and 1 eat a lot as well,\u201d Lin Xiaowan replied.\nShe aimed at the target and released an arrow at this moment. As expected, her posture was not quite right, and she lacked strength. Before the arrow even touched the target, it fell to the ground again. However, the distance between the arrow and the target was much closer than before. Moreover, it was not like the arrows fell short of the target every time. She had hit the target twice before this.\nGu Yuwu clapped her hands and said, \u201cNot bad, not bad. You\u2019ve improved a little.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan picked up another arrow and said, \u201cAlthough I look thin, there\u2019s no problem with my weight. Previously, when I went for a checkup, the doctor said that my weight is okay!\u201d\n\u201cReally?\u201d Gu Yuwu looked surprised. She held Lin Xiaowan\u2019s wrist and said, \u201cLook, you don\u2019t have any meat here.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan shrugged. Then, she thought of something and asked, \u201cOh, right. When will the fantasy drama start airing?\u201d\nGu Yuwu smiled. \u201cNot so soon. It\u2019ll be aired in December or after mid-January\u2026\u201d\n\u201cSo long? 1 thought I\u2019d be aired soon after the filming was completed,\u201d Lin Xiaowan said.\n\u201cHow\u2019s that possible? There are many things to do apart from filming. Moreover, after post-production, it has to be sent for review. The process of reviewing also takes a while,\u201d Gu Yuwu replied.\nWhen Lin Xiaowan returned home, she thought about the vlog Gu Yuwu had filmed during their trip. She kept checking Gu Yuwu\u2019s page the first two days after the trip. However, Gu Yuwu did not post the vlog. When they met earlier, Lin Xiaowan planned to ask about it, but she completely forgot about it.\nLin Xiaowan logged into her account before she went to Gu Yuwu\u2019s page. This time, Gu Yuwu finally uploaded her vlog.\nGu Yuwu had told Lin Xiaowan that she would not reveal Lin Xiaowan\u2019s face so Lin Xiaowan was very assured. However, even if her face was not revealed, she was still very curious since this is the first time she appeared in a vlog. Moreover, although her face was not revealed, her voice could be heard, and her body could be seen. She wanted to see what others thought of her.\nThe number of views for the video was very high. Gu Yuwu\u2019s followers had increased since the last time Lin Xiaowan logged in.\n\nLin Xiaowan watched the ten-minute vlog that Gu Yuwu uploaded.\nApart from the chef that helped them prepare the food for the picnic, almost everyone in the vlog was \u2019headless\u2019. One person even commented jokingly, \u201cWhen I have money, I\u2019ll definitely buy a few \u2018heads\u2019 for President Gu!\u201d\nLin Xiaowan watched the video with great interest. At the end of the video, she discovered that Gu Yuwu had included a photo of her and Huo Zheng at the last step of the stairs when Huo Zheng was carrying her. However, both of their faces were covered with cartoon stickers.\nGu Yuwu had sent the original photo to Lin Xiaowan, and Lin Xiaowan had used it as her screensaver. It was clear that she really liked the photo a lot.\nMost of the comments were directed at Gu Yuwu, but there were also a few comments directed at the other three people. There were quite a lot of comments, and Lin Xiaowan sighed in relief when she saw that there were no negative comments.\nAt the beginning of July, Lin Xiaowan and Zhu Yingyue\u2019s dessert shop finally opened for business.\nZhu Yingyue did not personally make the desserts. Instead, she was in charge of the main operations of the shop. If she had to make pastries as well on top of taking care of her children, it would be too tiring for her.\nThe shop was big so they needed more than one patissier. They also hired more than ten workers.\nLin Xiaowan was a silent partner. She did not have much to do and only had to show up on the opening day.\nThe name of the shop was given by Lin Xiaowan. It was very simple and direct; it was called Dessert Shop. The signboard was white, and the words were yellow. There were a few pictures of desserts on it as well. All in all, it was simple and direct.\nWhen Lin Xiaowan stood at the entrance and looked at the signboard, she felt a little speechless.\n\u201cThe dessert shop looks expensive\u2026 Will people even come in?\u201d\nHowever, Lin Xiaowan\u2019s worries were proven to be unfounded. The wealthy ladies came in waves. Apart from the wealthy ladies, there were also wealthy men dressed in suits and leather shoes.\nThe shop was located by a busy street. There were not many parking spaces. If one came early, perhaps one would be lucky to find a parking space. Otherwise, one could only park by the roadside. There were all kinds of luxury cars parked near the shop. If one did not know better, one would think there was an event for the wealthy.\nLin Xiaowan stood behind the counter as she watched women and men of a certain age chatting merrily as they made their way upstairs, led by a staff member. She could not help but feel perplexed.\n\u2018What\u2019s happening? This is a dessert shop, right? Why isn\u2019t there a single youngster here?\u2019\nBased on the appearances of the customers, they did not seem like they were here to buy desserts. Instead, they looked more like they were here to discuss business cooperation..\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

Since the rooms were not fully enclosed, there was not much privacy. They could easily see who was next to them as long as they stood up and walked a few steps. Apart from that, if they spoke too loudly, they could be easily heard by others.\nFor this reason, the customers did not stay for long. They sat down for a while and made small talk before they left. Before they left, they did not forget to bring their unfinished pastries with them.\nGu Yuwu had something to do so she arrived a little late. When she arrived, it was already dinner time. She saw Lin Xiaowan resting her chin on her hands and leaning against the counter, looking bored, as soon as she entered. She walked over and knocked on the counter as she said teasingly, \u201cWhat are you doing? Are you sure you\u2019re open for business?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan returned to her senses. When she saw Gu Yuwu, she perked up immediately. \u201cYou\u2019re here!\u201d\nGu Yuwu nodded and asked, \u201cHow are the sales today? It seems a little deserted on this floor.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan sighed. \u201cThe sales are good, and the desserts are selling well\u2026\u201d \u201cThen, why are you sighing?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan said as she furrowed her brows slightly, \u201cI\u2019m just confused. Everyone who came in today is in their thirties and forties\u2026 Are they really here for the desserts?\u201d\nThe dessert shop had a membership system. Members would get a 15% discount. This was a common sales tactic. Almost all the customers who went upstairs today became members and topped up their cards. However, strangely, when they were reloading their cards, they felt that the amount of money was too little. It seemed as though they could not wait to put a lot of money into their cards.\nGu Yuwu laughed and said, \u201cLet me have a look at the membership.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan handed it over to Gu Yuwu, still perplexed.\nLin Xiaowan did not envision a luxury dessert shop when she opened it. The shop was decorated brightly and renovated in such a way that allowed sunlight to stream into the shop. Soothing music was also played in the shop. Lin Xiaowan envisioned the shop to be a place where lively young people hung out. Apart from that, the prices of the desserts were also jointly decided by her and Zhu Yingyue. Although the ingredients they used were expensive, the prices of the desserts were very reasonable.\nAfter becoming a member, one could choose to reload the card with a minimum of 30 yuan and a maximum of 3,000 yuan.\nUnexpectedly, the customers who came today asked very kindly if they could apply for ten membership cards and reload each card with 3,000 yuan. They said they wanted to give the cards to their family and friends.\n\nWhen Lin Xiaowan told Gu Yuwu about this, Gu Yuwu asked, \u201cThen what did you say?\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t say anything since they weren\u2019t asking me. What else can the staff say?\u201d Lin Xiaowan said. Then, she imitated one of the salesclerks\u2019 expression and tone as she said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry but the membership is bound to your phone number. When your family and friends come, they can apply for a membership with their phone numbers.\u201d\nAfter that, Lin Xiaowan asked, \u201cDid they really come for the desserts?\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Gu Yuwu asked before laughing.\nLin Xiaowan rolled her eyes. \u201cObviously they didn\u2019t!\u201d\nLin Xiaowan\u2019s relationship with Huo Zheng was not a secret, and it was also not a secret that she opened a dessert shop. It took quite a while for them to open the shop due to the renovation. As such, there was a lot of time for the news to spread.\nLin Xiaowan thought about it for a moment before she asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s the point of them coming today? They\u2019re not familiar with me, and I\u2019m not familiar with them. There\u2019s no point in them coming today\u2026\u201d\nLin Xiaowan spent most of her time behind the counter today, observing the situation. When the customers came today, they were led upstairs by a worker, and the worker would take their orders upstairs.\nZhu Yingyue did not even show her face. After all, she was responsible for things like finance and management.\nThose people wanted to use Lin Xiaowan to get closer to Huo Zheng, but they did not have a chance to do so at all.\nGu Yuwu said, \u201cWho said there\u2019s no point? If there\u2019s a chance in the future, they can use this as a chance to make conversation\u2026\u201d\nLin Xiaowan shrugged. \u201cI still don\u2019t understand them.\u201d\n\u201cWell, let\u2019s not talk about this anymore. Anyway, it\u2019s a good thing that they came. They came to help you make money.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan nodded. \u201cYou have a point. However, 1 hope the desserts don\u2019t go to waste\u2026\u201d\nThe men and women who came always packed the desserts before they left. Lin Xiaowan was puzzled. If they were going to take the desserts away, what was the point of sitting down? Why were they sitting down without eating the desserts?\nAt this time, Gu Yuwu asked, \u201cDid you save my seat for me?\u201d\n\nLin Xiaowan nodded. \u201cOf course! 1 remember it\u2019s the one by the window.\u201d\nGu Yuwu walked to the display and said, \u201cLet me see what\u2019s delicious. I\u2019ll have some desserts before dinner. After I\u2019m done, let\u2019s have dinner.\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Lin Xiaowan replied, \u201cThe patissiers were hired by Zhu Yingyue. They\u2019ll take turns working. Today\u2019s patissier is a handsome foreign middle-aged man. The desserts and pastries he made are really, really, really delicious! 1 had so many of them today!\u201d\nLin Xiaowan was like a mouse that had fallen into a rice pot today. She ate to her heart\u2019s content. She really wished she could eat here for three meals a day every day.\nGu Yuwu shook her head and said, \u201cYou should restrain yourself a little. Also, be careful that you don\u2019t suffer from tooth decay.\u201d\n\u201cI know,\u201d Lin Xiaowan said as she led Gu Yuwu upstairs.\nThe decorations upstairs were slightly different from those downstairs. Carved mahogany partitions separated the tables. For privacy, curtains hung at the entrance of the booths. The style of the curtains was very cute, and it was obvious that Lin Xiaowan had chosen them.\nA dark green floor-length muslin curtain with tassels hung by the window. The table next to the window was also the table that Lin Xiaowan had reserved for Gu Yuwu.\nIn the end, Gu Yuwu and Lin Xiaowan did not have dinner together. Huo Zheng came over to pick Lin Xiaowan up.\nLin Xiaowan had been texting Huo Zheng the entire day, telling him about everything that had happened today. However, it did not stop her from her repeating a few important points to him when she saw him again.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about them,\u201d Huo Zheng said indifferently.\nLin Xiaowan nodded in agreement. \u201c1 know. 1 don\u2019t know them so I\u2019m just watching the show. However, although 1 don\u2019t know them, 1 know the purpose of their visit.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan laughed before she continued to say, \u201cWhen I\u2019m watching them, it makes me feel like I\u2019m sober while they\u2019re all drunk\u2026\u201d\n\u201cAre you tired today?\u201d Huo Zheng asked with a gentle smile on his face.\n\u201cI\u2019m not tired at all. By the way, Sister Cheng\u2019s friend came as well today. She is the one who makes perfumes. I told you about this before. She said that she would make changes to Sister Cheng\u2019s perfume for me so it\u2019ll be unique\u2026\u201d \u201cCheng Ruitong?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Lin Xiaowan nodded and asked, \u201cDo you know her?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ve cooperated before.\u201d\n\u201cSister Cheng wanted to come today, but she was too busy with work.

After the first day\u2019s chaos and confusion, the workers were able to deal with them with ease today.\nLin Xiaowan was still standing behind the counter. Qiao You\u2019an planned to bring her two children today so she was waiting for them.\nQiao You\u2019an could not come yesterday so she sent a gift first.\nThis was also in line with Lin Xiaowan\u2019s wish. After all, many people knew the members of the Huo family. If Qiao You\u2019an had shown up yesterday, everyone would definitely surround Qiao You\u2019an, and Lin Xiaowan would not be able to watch the show in peace yesterday. Even when Huo Zheng came to pick her up yesterday, she asked him to wait in the car and did not allow him to come into the shop.\nQiao You\u2019an chose a time when there were fewer people before she came. After waking the children up from their nap, she brought them over to the desserts shop at about 3 PM.\nWhen Huo Dabao and Huo Erbao saw Lin Xiaowan, whom they had not seen in a long time, they greeted her enthusiastically.\n\u201cSister Xiaowan!\u201d\nAmused, Qiao You\u2019an said to her two sons, \u201cThe two of you dare to call her \u2018Sister Xiaowan\u2019 only when your uncle isn\u2019t around. Otherwise, he\u2019ll scold both of you again.\u201d\nHuo Dabao made a face before he rushed to the display and said, \u201cSister Xiaowan, there are so many delicious desserts! Since you\u2019re here every day, do you eat them every day?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan said excitedly, \u201cOf course! There\u2019s no one to tell me no so I can eat whatever I want!\u201d\nHuo Dabao took a deep breath, inhaling the sweet fragrance in the air before he said again, \u201cIt\u2019s summer vacation now. Can we come over every day to play?\u201d\n\nQiao You\u2019an reminded her son, \u201cI\u2019m afraid that\u2019s not possible. You won\u2019t be free every day even though it\u2019s summer vacation.\u201d Then, she asked Lin Xiaowan, \u201cThere\u2019s a horse stable in Beichen Oasis. Do you want to go?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan crouched down and brought the cakes and pastries that Huo Dabao and Huo Erbao liked as she replied, \u201cBut I don\u2019t know how to ride horses\u2026\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine. Someone will teach you. The horses in the stable are all trained and gentle.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan had never ridden a horse before so she agreed after giving it some thought. As she led Qiao You\u2019an and the two children upstairs, she complained about the strange customers again before she said, \u201cThey don\u2019t know me well, but they should know you, right?\u201d\nThere were not many people upstairs at this time. Lin Xiaowan brought the others to Gu Yuwu\u2019s reserved seat. This was the only booth that was covered with a floor-to-ceiling curtain, which highlighted its uniqueness.\nQian You\u2019an replied, \u201cThey know me, but I might not know them. These people speak with hidden meanings so I don\u2019t really like dealing with them. Don\u2019t worry. If they try to approach you, don\u2019t panic. If you don\u2019t want to deal with them, just ignore them.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan nodded in understanding.\nWhen Zhu Yingyue and Lin Xiaowan opened the dessert shop, they did not have any special plans for the second floor. However, after the opening, many people liked going there.\nThe men and women in their thirties and forties came and left very quickly. Who knew who helped promote the shop, but suddenly, there was an influx of young girls who visited the dessert shop, taking photos and signing up to be members. There would be even more of them during the weekends. There were also a few handsome young men in their groups. They would order the desserts and a pot of tea, chatting for a long time. If there were no seats on the second floor, they would sit and wait on the first floor. All of them wanted to sit on the second floor. As such, the first floor, which was also a place to enjoy the desserts, became more like a waiting room.\nLin Xiaowan was puzzled by this phenomenon. Before the shop was due to close the next day, she walked around the shop, but did not find what was so special about the second floor.\nZhu Yingyue sent Lin Xiaowan an article along with a message.\n[Zhu Yingyue: Our dessert shop seems to have become very popular online. Perhaps, we should change our marketing strategy.]\nLin Xiaowan was even more puzzled when she read the article.\nThe post was posted in a lifestyle app with many recommendations, which became popular two years ago. When it first became popular, Lin Xiaowan downloaded it as well. However, she was soon put off by the exaggerated and sometimes false advertising on the app. The advertisements were all hidden, and the promotional text was too exaggerated. Most of the advertisements had the same template. They did not look sincere, and they were not unique.\n\nFor this reason, Lin Xiaowan was initially unhappy when she saw that the dessert shop was recommended on the app. It felt like that dessert shop had become cheaper.\nThe photos that accompanied the post showed the second floor and a few desserts. It was filled with praise, emphasizing the value, taste, and appearance of the desserts. The article was so good that Lin Xiaowan wondered if it was really referring to her shop for a moment.\nAfter reading the article, Lin Xiaowan searched for the dessert shop online and found many articles promoting it. After that, she sent a message to Zhu Yingyue.\n[Lin Xiaowan: Are you the one who promoted our shop?]\n[Zhu Yingyue: No. I checked and saw our sales were very good so I\u2019m not in a hurry to promote it.]\n[Zhu Yingyue: However, a few days ago, I was checking our reviews and found all these posts and articles. The post I sent you is the most popular one. The poster is rather popular. Her contents usually show her daily life. She seems like she\u2019s from a wealthy family. She probably visited our shop after hearing about it.]\n[Zhu Yingyue: Do you remember her?]\nThere were too many people who visited the shop every day. Moreover, Lin Xiaowan was not someone who greeted the customers enthusiastically. She could not even remember most of their faces, let alone have any impression of them.\n[Lin Xiaowan: No.]\nIn Zhu Yingyue\u2019s opinion, this was a positive thing. She felt that they could use this opportunity to attract a wider range of customers.\nAs for Lin Xiaowan, she felt that the shop already had many customers as it was, but she still agreed with Zhu Yingyue. After all, Zhu Yingyue was in charge of the shop\u2019s operation. Moreover, the more customers there were, the more money they would make. Why would she have any objection?\nApart from this matter, Zhu Yingyue also spoke to Lin Xiaowan about her plan. She wanted to decorate the booths on the second floor in different styles, and she also wanted to start a reservation system for the second floor, which she wanted to make exclusive for members. Apart from that, she also wanted to add minimum spending for those dining on the second floor.\nWith this, customers had to be a member to be seated on the second floor. After becoming a member, customers had to spend a certain amount of money as well to sit on the second floor.\nAfter hearing about these additions, Lin Xiaowan was slightly worried.

It was just starting to become famous, and if they were to make changes according to Zhu Yingyue\u2019s suggestion, Lin Xiaowan was worried that no one would come.\nZhu Yingyue laughed at Lin Xiaowan\u2019s naivety. She said, \u201cI\u2019m sure you know better than me why we have so many customers as soon as we opened for business. As long as you\u2019re around, you don\u2019t have to worry about not having customers.\u201d\nZhu Yingyue continued to say, \u201cEven if people object to it, it\u2019ll only be temporary. Moreover, after we make these changes, it\u2019ll also help us gather more quality customers. By the way, I\u2019m guessing those people promoting our shop probably know you\u2026\u201d\nLin Xiaowan was slightly surprised. She did not think of this at all. She assumed that only those slightly older customers had ulterior motives. She did not think that those young girls and young men had those thoughts as well. Nonetheless, it was not a bad thing. She did not think much about it and let Zhu Yingyue do what she wanted.\nZhu Yingyue created a public account on Speaker, a social media platform. The first thing she posted was the changes to the second floor. She even bought some traffic, which attracted a lot of attention and comments.\nDue to the renovations on the second floor, it was closed for a few days.\nLin Xiaowan downloaded Speaker and went to have a look. There were many comments, and most of them were negative.\nMany passersby mocked the dessert shop, saying that the desserts were ugly and that they were money hungry. Some people even wondered why there had to be an exclusive system for the second floor when it was just a dessert shop for people to enjoy desserts.\n\nThere were also people who said that they planned to visit the dessert shop but changed their minds after learning about the changes.\nSome people who had already visited the dessert shop also slandered the desserts, saying that the desserts were not delicious and the ingredients used were not good. In conclusion, they said they would not visit again in the future.\nLin Xiaowan was naturally unhappy. The patissiers they hired were all very skilled. On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, they would serve Western desserts, and they would serve Shangxia desserts on Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday. In her opinion, everything was delicious.\nLin Xiaowan took a few screenshots and sent them to Zhu Yingyue.\n[Lin Xiaowan: Are these comments really not a problem?]\nZhu Yingyue did not seem to care at all.\n[Zhu Yingyue: It doesn\u2019t matter. Look at the commenters. Almost none of them are our target audience.]\n[Zhu Yingyue: Moreover, I\u2019ve made it clear that the changes only apply to the second floor. Nothing has changed on the first floor. In any case, those who want to go to the second floor will still go to the second floor. This won\u2019t affect anything.]\nLin Xiaowan thought about it and agreed with Zhu Yingyue. There was nothing to worry about. Even after the changes on the second floor, there would not be fewer customers.\nMoreover, not all the comments were negative. There were many people who were quite supportive, especially those who had visited before. They knew that the second floor would be redecorated, and they would no longer have to wait for a long time to go to the second floor now that a reservation system was in place.\nZhu Yingyue was in charge of the second floor\u2019s renovation. However, she still kept Lin Xiaowan in the loop.\n\nLin Xiaowan also did not ask many questions since she trusted Zhu Yingyue.\nThe day before the renovation was completed, Zhu Yingyue added Lin Xiaowan as an administrator of the dessert shop\u2019s account.\nSpeaker users could not add each other as friends, but they could follow each other\u2019s accounts.\nLin Xiaowan searched for Huo Zheng and discovered he was not Speaker. There were only accounts of Huo Corporation and its subsidiary companies.\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you have a personal account?\u201d Lin Xiaowan asked Huo Zheng, \u201cI saw many presidents and CEOs have their own personal accounts. They also have a lot of followers\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t need it\u2026\u201d\nHuo Zheng had no interest in such things. Needless to say, the company accounts were all handled by relevant employees. He did not see a need for him to have an account.\nAfter that, Lin Xiaowan searched for Gu Yuwu, and she was shocked when she saw that Gu Yuwu had 4.0 million followers. She quickly clicked on the \u2018follow\u2019 button, and she became an inconspicuous follower among the 40 million followers.\nLin Xiaowan used the default profile picture, which was of a robot. She did not have many photos on her phone, after all. After scrolling through her photo album for a long time, apart from photos of desserts, she found that she only had photos from her trip to Mount An. Initially, she wanted to use the photo of her and Huo Zheng, but suddenly, she felt like she wanted to keep the photo to herself.\n\u2018What should I use as my profile picture?\u2019\nLin Xiaowan did not want to use cartoon avatars. In the end, she decided to use the photo of an inanimate object as her profile picture. She wandered around the house, looking for things she could use as her profile picture.\nMeanwhile, Huo Zheng watched Lin Xiaowan wander around the house like a headless fly. One moment, she took photos of a basket of fruits, and the next moment, she took photos of the flowers on the table.. Finally, he could not help but ask in confusion, \u201cQingqing, what are you doing?\u201d\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

However, no matter how many photos she took, she was not satisfied. She found her hand and fingers were small and chubby.\nWhen Lin Xiaowan turned around and saw Huo Zheng, an idea appeared in her mind. She skipped over and said, \u201cSister Zhu made me an administrator of the dessert shop\u2019s account on Speaker. I just created an account so 1 was thinking about what photo 1 should use for my profile picture.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan held Huo Zheng\u2019s hand. His fingers were slender and well-defined, and his hand was much bigger than hers. Veins could also be seen on the back of his hand.\nThe contrast between their hands was especially obvious in the camera. Seeing this, she could not help but say, \u201cMy hand is so fair\u2026\u201d\nLin Xiaowan was very pale, and she was particularly eye-catching when she stood under the sun. It was as though she was glowing.\nHuo Zheng smiled and held her hand. He watched as she tried to find a good angle to take photos of their hands.\nFinally, Lin Xiaowan found a photo she was satisfied with. She added a filter before she uploaded it.\nLin Xiaowan lay on the bed and continued to look at her phone.\nSeeing this, Huo Zheng reached out for her phone and said, \u201cDon\u2019t lie down and play with your phone.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan let go of her phone, letting Huo Zheng take it. When she saw him locking the screen and putting it on the bedside table, she reminded him, \u201cCharge my phone. It\u2019s almost out of battery.\u201d\nHuo Zheng turned off the bedside lamp and lay down before he said, \u201cCharge it tomorrow.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan said worriedly, \u201cI\u2019m going to the equestrian club with Sister You\u2019an tomorrow. Will I have time to charge it?\u201d\n\nHuo Zheng kissed her forehead and tucked her in as he said, \u201cThere\u2019ll be enough time.\u201d\nThe next morning, Huo Zheng woke up early to exercise. He planned to have breakfast with Lin Xiaowan before they made their way to the equestrian club.\nRecently, Lin Xiaowan had been lazing in bed and sleeping in. It was no different this morning. Huo Zheng kissed her and gently coaxed her to wake up.\nWhen they were having breakfast, Qiao You\u2019an called Huo Zheng when she discovered she could not get through to Lin Xiaowan.\n\u201cI forgot to charge my phone!\u201d Lin Xiaowan exclaimed, smacking her forehead.\nJust as she was about to get up, Huo Zheng stopped her. He told her to eat her breakfast while he went to get her phone for her.\nLin Xiaowan hugged Huo Zheng and gave him a kiss, saying, \u201cBrother, you\u2019re so nice!\u201d\nHowever, before Huo Zheng could hold her and kiss her back, she had already returned to her seat, happily eating her breakfast. He laughed softly when he saw this.\nShe would only call him \u2018Brother\u2019 when she needed something. Otherwise, she would call him Huo Zheng. What a cunning girl!\nDuring the journey, they passed by the dessert shop that had been renovated twice. Seeing that it was open, Lin Xiaowan wanted to go in and buy some desserts for the two children.\nHuo Zheng did not tell the driver to pull over. Instead, he said, \u201cEating too many desserts will cause one\u2019s teeth to fall.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan was slightly unhappy, but she did not protest. Seeing that the driver was in a difficult position, she gestured for the driver to continue driving as she said, \u201cAlright, alright. We won\u2019t buy any desserts. There are not many desserts at this time anyway.\u201d\nThe patissiers started work at 8.30 AM, and it was only 9 AM now. As such, there were really not many desserts at this time.\nLin Xiaowan showed Huo Zheng her pearly white teeth and said, \u201cLook! My teeth are fine! They\u2019re not going to fall. I brush my teeth for at least two minutes every time.\u201d\nHuo Zheng only tapped the tip of her nose and did not say anything.\n\nSometimes, he wondered if it was a good idea for Lin Xiaowan to open a dessert shop. It was good that she was keeping herself busy. She had also been completing the assignments that Hong Minhua gave her in the shop. However, her passion for desserts was a little too much. It was not just a novelty. Her love for desserts seemed to grow stronger by the day. Sometimes, she ate desserts as though they were rice.\nThis gave Huo Zheng a headache. However, there was nothing he could do about it. He could not say no to her at all when she hugged him and called him \u2018Brother\u2019. He could only sigh and give in to her, making sure her three meals were nutritious enough.\nLin Xiaowan would listen to Huo Zheng most of the time. When she did not listen to him, she would take the initiative to admit her mistake before she acted coquettishly with him.\nLin Xiaowan put on a full set of protective gear. After all, it was her first time riding a horse. When she came out after changing, she saw Huo Zheng waiting for her not far away with a brownish-gray horse.\nSeeing that Huo Dabao and Huo Erbao were not around when she had just seen them a moment ago, she asked Qiao You\u2019an, \u201cWhere did Dabao and Erbao go?\u201d\n\u201cThey left with the coach.\u201d\nHuo Dabao and Huo Erbao were with their coach, accompanied by their nanny. Moreover, this was not their first time riding a horse. As such, Qiao You\u2019an felt assured even though this was a new race track.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll see them later.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan found it difficult to get on the horse. She did not dare to pull the reins tightly, afraid that she would hurt the horse. With one foot on the stirrups, she tried to lift her other leg. Alas, before she could go any further, she fell again.\nQiao You\u2019an chuckled. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. Don\u2019t think so much. If you fall, we\u2019ll catch you.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan was timid. Fortunately, the horse had a very good temper. It stood there obediently, swishing its tail as she tried to get on it. For the first time, she realized how tall horses were. She looked at Huo Zheng subconsciously, asking for help.\nThe equestrian coach also laughed. Then, he left and returned with a small stool, which seemed like the ones used in ancient times to get on and off a carriage.\nLin Xiaowan felt embarrassed.\nThe stool was about knee-high. She supported herself using Huo Zheng\u2019s arm and stood up shakily. After that, the coach handed the reins to her and patted the saddle before he said, \u201cHold onto this place. It should be easier to cross over if the position is higher.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan gritted her teeth, determined to use more strength this time. With Huo Zheng\u2019s support, this time she successfully got on the horse\u2019s back. She could not help but feel scared when she saw how high she was sitting. Moreover, there was no protection on both sides. However, despite feeling scared, she also felt eager to ride a horse.\nSince she was a beginner, the coach held the reins and led the horse for her around the field a few times. She was naturally not allowed to ride alone. Even Huo Dabao and Huo Erbao who had ridden horses before were not left alone and had a coach accompanying them.\nWhile the equestrian coach led the horse around, he also told Lin Xiaowan what to take note of..\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

His face was expressionless, and his eyes were fixed on them, looking just like a bodyguard.\nLin Xiaowan\u2019s riding speed was basically the same as someone walking briskly. She gradually learned some skills as she sat on the horse\u2019s back. She was a little unsatisfied and wanted to go faster, but she did not dare to leave the equestrian coach\u2019s side.\nLet alone her, even the equestrian coach did not dare to leave her side. After all, falling off a horse was not a trivial matter.\nLin Xiaowan watched as Huo Zheng leisurely rode his horse to the side and let it graze the field. An idea appeared in her mind, and she leaned forward slightly and asked the coach, \u201cCan two people ride on a horse?\u201d\nThe equestrian coach did not know why Lin Xiaowan asked this. He only hesitated for a moment before she replied, \u201cYes.\u201d\nIn fact, this depended on the rules of the equestrian club. There were many people who did not know how to ride but wanted to experience the feeling of galloping on the horse. For this reason, a coach would ride with them.\n\u201cThen, can 1 ride with another person? I see there\u2019s a huge track over there. Can we go there?\u201d Lin Xiaowan asked again. She loosened her grip on the reins and pointed in a certain direction before she quickly held the reins tightly again.\nThe equestrian coach looked in the direction she pointed before he nodded. He thought to himself, \u2018This young woman is quite bold. That place is a free racing track, and it\u2019s very vast\u2026\u2019\nThe equestrian coach said, \u201cIf you feel comfortable now, I can take you there now.\u201d\n\u201cHow do two people ride on a horse? Is it similar to how people ride on horses in dramas?\u201d Lin Xiaowan asked.\n\u201cYes, it\u2019s similar,\u201d the equestrian coach said with a smile. He sounded a little proud as he continued to say, \u201cI have a master, and he\u2019s very good at horseback riding. He used to teach celebrities how to ride.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s amazing,\u201d Lin Xiaowan said before she asked, \u201cCan I ride with my boyfriend? 1 want to ride with him.\u201d\nThe equestrian coach looked a little troubled when he heard this. The equestrian club had just opened for business, but he knew the people who came here were all extraordinary; they were either noble or wealthy. It would be bad if something happened.\nIn the end, the equestrian coach expressed Lin Xiaowan\u2019s wish to Huo Zheng and Qiao You\u2019an, asking for their opinions. If they decided that they did not his assistance, they would have to sign an agreement.\nSince Lin Xiaowan had to wait for a while, she wanted to get off the horse first. She handed the reins to Huo Zheng.\nHuo Zheng patted her and got her to move forward a little. Then, he pulled on the reins before he flipped over neatly onto the horse.\nWhen the horse felt the extra weight, it raised its head and neighed, giving Lin Xiaowan a fright.\nAfter getting onto the horseback, Huo Zheng pulled Lin Xiaowan into his embrace. Seeing how nervous she was, he grinned before he spurred the horse on. After a while, he mischievously pulled on the reins to make the horse raise its front hooves.\nLin Xiaowan hugged him and exclaimed softly.\nUpon seeing this, Qiao You\u2019an, who was watching, said anxiously, \u201cWatch out! Don\u2019t hurt Xiaowan!\u201d\nHuo Zheng did not say anything, but the smile on his face became even more obvious. He lowered his head and gently kissed Lin Xiaowan\u2019s cheek, trying to comfort her.\nQiao You\u2019an rolled her eyes. At the same time, she felt slightly relieved as well. Huo Zheng did not avoid public displays of affection now, which was similar to his past self who was carefree and relaxed.\nBy the time the coach returned with the agreement, the couple was nowhere to be seen in the enclosed track. He was naturally anxious.\nThe couple could not wait any longer. Lin Xiaowan egged Huo Zheng a little, and Huo Zheng spurred the horse on, galloping away.\nIn the end, Qiao You\u2019an could only sigh and sign the agreement on Huo Zheng\u2019s behalf.\nMeanwhile, Huo Dabao and Huo Erbao were riding happily when Huo Erbao decided to get some water because he was thirsty. It was at this time that he saw the couple riding a horse on the field. Filled with excitement, he called out to his elder brother, \u201cBrother, Little Aunt is riding over there!\u201d\n\nWhen Huo Zheng was present, the two children would obediently address Lin Xiaowan as \u2018Little Aunt\u2019. When Huo Zheng was not present, they would address her as \u2018Sister Xiaowan\u2019. It could be said that they were quite skilled at \u2018obeying in the open and opposing in the dark\u2019.\nThe equestrian club occupied a huge piece of land. It was located in a remote suburb. Apart from Beichen Park, which was crowded during the weekend, it was relatively quiet here. For this reason, the equestrian club provided a good run for the horses even if it was not comparable to the real grassland.\nAfter Huo Erbao called out to Huo Dabao, Huo Dabao looked over and immediately saw the couple. He said excitedly, \u201c1 want to go there too!\u201d\nThe nanny heard this and tried to dissuade them. \u201cYou\u2019re both still young. If you ride like them, your little butts will hurt for a few days.\u201d\nThe two children really wanted to gallop on the horse like Huo Zheng and Lin Xiaowan. In the past, they were led around on the horses by their equestrian coach, and later on, they were allowed to ride without being led around. However, they had never ridden freely in such a manner. It was because they had never tried it before that they were eager to try it now.\nIn the end, the nanny had no choice but to call Qiao You\u2019an over.\nWhen Qiao You\u2019an heard that her two sons wanted to ride on the open track, she was going to object initially. However, after thinking about it, she hesitated. The two children wanted to do this because they had never tried it before. Even if she told them it was not suitable for them to do so, they would not believe her. After all, they had both taken riding lessons and could ride horses; they would definitely question why they could not ride the horses in the open track. In conclusion, it would be very difficult to dissuade them.\nSeeing that Qiao You\u2019an was wavering, Huo Dabao seized the opportunity and said pleadingly, \u201cMom, please! It\u2019ll be okay!\u201d\nQiao You\u2019an looked at the equestrian coach standing at the side and asked, \u201cIs it safe for children their age to ride there?\u201d\nAlthough there were no rules prohibiting that, the equestrian coach was a little hesitant. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the experience of riding horses like that with children. Moreover, due to their age, even if we bring them along to gallop on the horses, we won\u2019t dare to go too fast.\u201d\nHuo Dabao tried to compromise, saying in a childish voice, \u201cWhat about doing just one lap around the track?\u201d\nIn the end, Qiao You\u2019an gave in to the mo children.\nThe equestrian coaches chose new horses and brought the children with them to the open track.\nBefore getting on the horse, the two children kissed their mother loudly. \u201cMom, aren\u2019t you coming to play with us?\u201d Huo Dabao asked.\nQiao You\u2019an knew how to ride horses.

All that was left was happiness. When she saw the two children, she was even happier, wanting to see who could ride faster. After coming to an agreement with the others, she patted Huo Zheng\u2019s arm and whispered to him, \u201cDon\u2019t go too fast. Be a little slower than them.\u201d\nAfter all, the duo was still young.\n\u201cI know,\u201d Huo Zheng said, squeezing her hand.\nThe two children were very excited. It was the first time they were doing this, after all. They felt like they had benefited from Lin Xiaowan this time. If Lin Xiaowan were not here, they knew their mother would not allow them to play like this.\nHuo Dabao pointed in the direction of the lounge chairs and parasols, which were in the resting area, and said loudly, \u201cLittle Aunt, let\u2019s start from there and make a huge circle back!\u201d\nAt the same time, Huo Dabao drew a huge circle with his finger.\nLin Xiaowan nodded. \u201cAlright. If you win, 1\u201911 give you a gift card!\u201d\nThis was an ongoing game between Lin Xiaowan and the children. Although she usually listened to Huo Zheng, most of the time, she did as she pleased when it came to her daily entertainment. To try and get closer to the two children, she would give them gift cards in exchange for certain tasks.\nFor example, when Lin Xiaowan was too lazy to move, she would call the two children over to help her get something. In exchange, she would give them gift cards. The content of the gift cards was different. For example, they could use it to redeem a chance to eat spicy sticks or snacks that they could not usually eat.\nLin Xiaowan made these gift cards herself, and they could only redeem the cards from her. Sometimes, she would reuse the gift cards.\nThe gift cards were considered a relatively huge treat for the two children. Apart from special occasions, Lin Xiaowan rarely gave them gift cards. As such, they were naturally very interested in obtaining the gift cards and the rewards they carried.\nAfter Lin Xiaowan finished speaking, Huo Dabao said spiritedly and valiantly in his childish voice, \u201cOkay! My brother and I definitely won\u2019t lose!\u201d\n\nLin Xiaowan smiled wickedly and said, \u201cIf 1 win, i\u2019ll use the gift cards myself!\u201d\nAfter that, she acted like a villain and laughed sinisterly a few times.\nHuo Dabao urged his equestrian coach, \u201cWe mustn\u2019t lose!\u201d\nWith that, the two children took off first.\nLin Xiaowan patted Huo Zheng and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go after them!\u201d\nHuo Zheng rode to the starting point that Huo Dabao had chosen earlier. However, before he even reached the starting point, he took the lead and galloped away first. As he passed by the two children, he said to them in a deep voice, \u201cThe competition starts now.\u201d\nHuo Zheng did not stop at all as he spoke.\nUpon seeing this, Huo Dabao shouted indignantly, \u201cUncle, how can you be so shameless?! We haven\u2019t reached the starting point yet! \u201d\nHuo Erbao said anxiously to his equestrian coach, \u201cHurry up and chase after them! We have to overtake them!\u201d\nThe equestrian coach also felt very helpless. He could only clamp the horse\u2019s sides with his legs to increase the speed slightly. Alas, the speed was really lacking compared to Huo Zheng\u2019s speed.\nHuo Erbao was so anxious that he tried to get up, frightening the coach.\nThe equestrian coach reprimanded Huo Erbao lightly and told him to sit properly.\n\u201cHurry up and chase after them! Look, they\u2019ve run so far away! We have to surpass them!\u201d\nThe equestrian coach really wanted to curse at Huo Zheng. The elders of other families would be worried about their children in this situation, but Huo Zheng did not seem worried about the children at all.\nMeanwhile, Lin Xiaowan saw Huo Dabao s angry expression from afar. She slapped Huo Zheng\u2019s arm and said angrily, \u201cHave you forgotten what you promised me earlier?\u201d\nHuo Zheng raised an eyebrow and asked nonchalantly, \u201cWhat did 1 promise you earlier?1\u2018\n\n\u201cYou promised\u2026\u201d Lin Xiaowan said before she suddenly trailed off. It seemed like she had suggested going a little slower, and Huo Zheng only expressed that he understood; he did not explicitly promise he would do so.\nLin Xiaowan pretended to bite him before she said, \u201cYou\u2019re really unreasonable!\u201d\nHuo Zheng did not care at all. He only chuckled and said happily, \u201cNext time, when we have the time, we ll ride on the grassland. You\u2019ll like it even more\u2026\u201d\nIn Huo Zheng\u2019s opinion, this place was still too small.\nUnsurprisingly, Lin Xiaowan won in the end,\nHuo Dabao and Huo Erbao were rightfully indignant and wanted to argue with Huo Zheng, saying that they should race again fair and square.\nLin Xiaowan felt that the suggestion was acceptable, but Huo Zheng did not want to entertain them at all. He helped Lin Xiaowan off the horse as he said, \u201cI\u2019m tired now.\u201d\nAlthough Huo Zheng said he was tired, his expression and his actions did not show it at ail. On the contrary, he seemed energetic, clearly in a good mood.\nLin Xiaowan did not feel anything when her adrenaline was surging earlier. However, the moment she got off the horse, her legs softened.\nHuo Zheng quickly grabbed her, helping her to steady her footing.\nAfter regaining her footing, Lin Xiaowan felt that her thighs and butt were hurting. Initially, she still planned to persuade Huo Zheng to race with the two children again, but with the pain, she immediately dismissed that idea.\nTo appease the two children, Lin Xiaowan waved her hand and said, \u201cYour uncle broke the rules this time so it doesn\u2019t count. I\u2019ll still give each of you a gift card when we go back.\u201d\nThen, Lin Xiaowan added loudly, \u201cBoth of you should have won. Your uncle only won because he broke the rules!\u201d\nAlthough the two children, who were intelligent, could see through Lin Xiaowan\u2019s intention, they were tempted by the gift cards so they did not say anything. Moreover, they agreed with Lin Xiaowan; if their uncle did not cheat, they would have won. With that, they accepted Lin Xiaowan\u2019s words and obediently got off their horses.\nAs soon as the two children dismounted from their respective horses, they grimaced in pain.\n\u201cOuch!

He only stroked her head and helped her massage her legs.\nIn the evening, Zhu Yingyue sent a message to report the business for the day. It was filled with string after string of numbers, and honestly, Lin Xiaowan did not understand anything. In any case, based on the numbers at the bottom, she could still tell that the turnover was pretty good.\n[Zhu Yingyue: As expected, the changes we made didn\u2019t affect us.]\n[Zhu Yingyue: Moreover, Xiao Liu told me that the second floor is fully booked for the next three days.]\nLin Xiaowan was slightly surprised by this. She checked Speaker and discovered that she had more than 99 notifications on the app. Puzzled, she clicked on the notification button and discovered that most of the notifications were from members of the dessert shop\u2019s page. There was one notification that indicated she had been mentioned in a post.\nShe clicked on the notification hesitantly. The post was an advertisement for some facial cleansers. She did not bother reading through hundreds of comments. After all, she was not interested. She quickly clicked on the return button and returned to the notification page.\nAt this time, Lin Xiaowan\u2019s followers suddenly rose from 0 to 36. She did not think much about it, assuming they were just followers of the dessert shop. She cleared her notifications and quickly exited the app.\nLin Xiaowan planned to go to the dessert shop the next day, but she could not get out of bed the next day. Her back, legs, thighs, and butt hurt just like the time when she returned from Mount An. For a moment, she felt like she did not go horse riding and had climbed Mount An again.\nLin Xiaowan did not make things difficult for herself. She was not in need of money, after all. With that, she lazed around for another week before Qiao You\u2019an called her to meet at the dessert shop.\nThe employees of the dessert shop knew that Lin Xiaowan was the boss. She did not put on air and had a good temper; she spoke slowly and softly and was not aggressive at all. For these reasons, they liked her a lot.\n\n\u201cBoss, you\u2019re here!\u201d\nLin Xiaowan waved and asked, \u201cIs my sister-in-law here?\u201d\nAfter asking that, she realized the employee probably did not know who she was referring to so she added, \u201cHer surname is Qiao.\u201d\nThere were not many people with this surname. The employee did not even need to check the reservation list. She remembered it as soon as Lin Xiaowan mentioned it.\n\u201cSo that gentle woman is your sister-in-law. Yes, she\u2019s upstairs.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan made an OK gesture. When she passed by the display, she saw the blueberry cheesecake and brought it up with her.\nQian You\u2019an came with two women, one of whom Lin Xiaowan had met previously. The two of them were dressed conservatively and sat upright. Their hair was tied up meticulously, they smiled without showing their teeth, and they ate very slowly. Their mannerism was typical ladylike behavior of Shangxia.\nAfter the renovation, the privacy on the second floor had been enhanced. Zhu Yingyue had hired someone to design the layout, and Lin Xiaowan also liked the design a lot. Previously, when Lin Xiaowan came over to have a look, it had not taken shape yet. She was really surprised now that she saw the completed work.\nEach booth had its own style and decoration. The curtains, chairs, tables, and the like were all replaced. Each of the booths was exquisite.\nQiao You\u2019an was seated in the corner. An exquisite purple plant and a bonsai stood in the corner as decorative pieces while the ceiling was decorated with golden stars. Silver ornaments in the booth created a feeling that transported away from Shangxia.\nIt was a rather good place to take photos.\nWhen the three of them saw Lin Xiaowan, they waved and smiled at her, gesturing for her to take a seat.\nQiao You\u2019an introduced the older of the two women, saying, \u201cThis is Professor Hong\u2019s daughter, Madam Zheng. You can just call her Aunt Zheng.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan placed the blueberry cheesecake in the middle of the table before she took a seat next to Qiao You\u2019an. Then, she said with a smile, \u201cHello, Aunt Zheng.\u201d\nSubsequently, Lin Xiaowan looked at the other woman, whom she had met once. Despite only meeting the other party once, she remembered that the other party was Aunt Zhang. She said politely, \u201cHello, Aunt Zhang.\u201d\nAunt Zheng smiled as she looked at Lin Xiaowan and said, \u201cMy mom often mentions you to me. I\u2019ve even seen your paintings. You should visit when you\u2019re free.\u201d\n\nRecently, Lin Xiaowan was not very focused on painting. When Hong Minhua saw her, Hong Minhua would sigh and complain that her heart was only with the dessert shop. When she heard Aunt Zheng\u2019s words, she could not help but feel slightly guilty.\nThe two women were like elders. They asked how the dessert shop was doing and told her that their friends who visited the shop praised the shop\u2019s delicious desserts and unique decorations.\nLin Xiaowan said truthfully, \u201cActually, Sister Zhu is the one who did everything. I didn\u2019t do much.\u201d\n\u201cWhen we came, we saw many people downstairs. It seems like business is booming.\u201d\nQiao You\u2019an said, \u201cThe patissiers that she and Zhu Yingyue hired are top-notch. The ingredients they used are also high-quality, and the desserts are delicious. However, it seems like she\u2019s worried about people spending too much money so the price is very low as well. How can there not be many people?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan blushed slightly when she heard Qiao You\u2019an\u2019s words. \u201cSister\u2026\u201d\nThe three women laughed seeing that Lin Xiaowan was embarrassed.\nAunt Zheng had a very good impression of Lin Xiaowan. She said, speaking up for the latter, \u201cThat\u2019s also a way to earn money. In any case, she\u2019s young so she still has time to learn.\u201d\nMeanwhile, Qiao You\u2019an noticed Lin Xiaowan staring at the desserts on the table so she said, \u201cAlright, we should let Xiaowan eat. Look at her eyes. She can\u2019t even look away from the desserts.\u201d\nUpon hearing these words, the other two women quickly pushed a few desserts toward Lin Xiaowan.\n\u201cEat more. We\u2019re old now so we don\u2019t eat much.\u201d\nSeeing that there were no drinks on the table, Lin Xiaowan took the initiative to ask, \u201cWhat would you like to drink? I\u2019ll get them for you.\u201d\nThe drinks selection in the shop was not very wide; there were only tea and fruit juices. One could count the variety of drinks with one hand.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t really like sweet drinks. Do you have any recommendations for us?\u201d Qiao You\u2019an asked.\n\u201cIt\u2019s summer now. Would you like to have green tea or jasmine tea? Lin Xiaowan asked, \u201cI\u2019ll make sure not to add sugar to the pot of tea.\u201d\nThe women were not picky so in the end, Qiao You\u2019an chose green tea for them.\n\u201cLet\u2019s have green tea. To make it more refreshing, I\u2019ll add mint leaves as well.\nThey\u2019ll help with dispelling the heat..\u201d\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

I can\u2019t help but be gentle when I\u2019m talking to her.\u201d\nAunt Zhang chimed in, \u201cI felt the same way when 1 first met her. She\u2019s really beautiful and kind.\u201d\nThen, Aunt Zhang said to Qiao You\u2019an, \u201cYou should persuade Second Young Master Huo to bring her out more. She\u2019s so precious. He can\u2019t always hide her at home.\u201d\nQiao You\u2019an explained, \u201cShe doesn\u2019t really like going out that much. It\u2019s useless to speak to him. His wife has the final say at home.\u201d\nUpon hearing this, Aunt Zhang asked, \u201cBy the way, when did Xiaowan and Second Young Master Huo get married? Why didn\u2019t we hear anything about it?\u201d\nQiao You\u2019an shook her head and laughed. \u201cThey\u2019re not married yet. From the looks of it, they\u2019re not in a hurry to get married.\u201d\nQiao You\u2019an had spoken to Huo Zheng about this previously. In her opinion, the duo\u2019s relationship was very stable, and even if they were not in a hurry to get married, it was a good idea to get engaged first and let the outside world know about it. At that time, Huo Zheng wanted to wait a little longer. It was almost August now; perhaps, it was almost time.\nAunt Zheng said, \u201cYoung people nowadays prefer to get married later. My child is the same. He\u2019s not young anymore, but he doesn\u2019t even have a female friend around him, let alone a girlfriend.\u201d\nQiao You\u2019an laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re too anxious. 1 remember your son is only in his third year of high school. He\u2019s probably focused on studying now.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan was about to go to the kitchen to get tea bags when she was stopped by one of her employees standing behind the counter. She asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\nThe employee replied, \u201cWhen you went upstairs earlier, someone suddenly came over and asked me if the person who went upstairs was you. I asked, but he didn\u2019t give me a reason. I felt that it was really strange so I told him it wasn\u2019t you. I just said that you were a friend of the boss.\u201d\nThe employee continued to say, \u201cAfter that, he asked me when you would come, but 1 said I wasn\u2019t sure and that you rarely came to the shop. After that, the few of them left regretfully.\u201d\n\u201cThe few of them?\u201d Lin Xiaowan raised an eyebrow.\n\n\u201cThere were three of them,\u201d the employee said with a nod.\nLin Xiaowan did not expect this. Nonetheless, she was very satisfied with the employee\u2019s perfunctory response to them. She gave the other party a thumbs-up and said, \u201cWell done! If anyone asks in the future, you can just say that to them.\u201d\nUpon hearing this, the employee sighed in relief. Then, she said, clearly more relaxed now, \u201cAlright. By the way, what are you doing? Do you need my help?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan raised the teapot in her hand and said, \u201cNo need. My sister-in-law and her friends don\u2019t like sweet drinks so I\u2019m making a pot of tea for them. It\u2019s very simple so 1 can do it myself.\u201d\nAfter a moment, she added, \u201cI think there are many customers who don\u2019t like sweet drinks as well. Perhaps we should consider adding only tea with nothing else to the menu\u2026\u201d\nZhu Yingyue and Lin Xiaowan were open to listening to their employees\u2019 opinions and suggestions. If they had any good ideas, they were welcome to speak to the duo.\nThe employee nodded in agreement. \u201cI agree. There were quite a few customers who asked us to recommend drinks that weren\u2019t so sweet. I think it\u2019s a good idea to serve plain tea.\u201d\n\u201cAlright. I\u2019ll speak to Sister Zhu about this\u2026\u201d\nAfter Lin Xiaowan was done making the mint green tea, she carried the pot of tea up to the second floor. When she was walking up the stairs, she saw a beautiful woman standing at the stairwell, texting on her phone.\nWhen the woman saw Lin Xiaowan, her eyes lit up, and she extended her jade-like arm to stop Lin Xiaowan. She asked curiously, \u201cAre you Lin Xiaowan?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan studied the other party carefully. Seeing that the other party did not seem to harbor any ill intentions, she laughed a little awkwardly and feigned ignorance as she said, \u201cI\u2019m not. I\u2019m just working here.\u201d\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry to have bothered you,\u201d the beautiful woman said with an apologetic smile on her face.\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Lin Xiaowan replied before she hurried away.\nAfter Lin Xiaowan entered the booth, the beautiful woman still stood in the same place, typing on her phone.\nMeanwhile, the other customers who had been paying attention to the movements outside began to discuss among themselves.\n\u201cDid you see that? She entered that booth again\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I saw her bringing a pot of tea to Madam Huo\u2019s booth. I think she\u2019s Second Madam Huo\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll go down and ask again\u2026\u201d\nOne of them went down to inquire about the matter and returned, looking skeptical and confused.\n\u201cSo?\u201d\n\u201cThe employee said that it was not her. She\u2019s just a friend who came to help\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWell, it makes sense if she\u2019s a friend. Otherwise, how could she be acquainted with Madam Huo if she was just a simple employee of the shop?\u201d\n\u201cAlright, don\u2019t talk about this anymore. By the way, the desserts here are really good. I\u2019m going to buy some back later. My girlfriend likes them.\u201d\nThe older men and women who visited the shop initially came to get closer to Lin Xiaowan. However, after their visit, they discovered that the desserts were truly delicious, and there were many varieties. Not only that, but the prices were extremely low, especially for them. With this, many of them became loyal customers.\nIt rained a lot during summer in Shengjing. For several days in a row, it was cloudy in the afternoon. After that, there would be heavy rain.\nWhen the weather was bad, there would be fewer customers at the shop.\nLin Xiaowan also did not go to the dessert shop when the weather was bad. She stayed at home, chatting on the phone or painting in the studio.\nPreviously, Lin Xiaowan had found a unique and beautiful seashell on the beach. She had commissioned a jewelry designer to make it into a brooch after she returned. It was almost finished, and the designer sent her a photo, asking her to have a look.\nGu Yuwu helped Lin Xiaowan get in touch with the jewelry designer, and the price was very low. After all, the other party was still a student. However, despite being a student, the other party had won a few competitions. Although the other party was not famous, her designs were very unique and beautiful.\nWhen Lin Xiaowan looked at the designer\u2019s portfolio, she felt that the other party was really talented. Moreover, perhaps she was new, her attitude was also very good. For all these reasons, Lin Xiaowan agreed to work with her.\nThe jewelry designer was not based on Shengjing so Lin Xiaowan had to send the seashell over. The designer also selected the gemstones that would be embedded into the seashell. After Lin Xiaowan confirmed it, she got to work immediately.\nThe jewelry worked very quickly. As soon as she received the seashell, she got to work immediately..\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

Although it was not her money, Lin Xiaowan\u2019s heart ached when she thought about the tens of thousands of yuan she spent on them.\nAfter she was done discussing the matter of the brooch, Lin Xiaowan had nothing to do so she went on Speaker. She found that she had a few more followers. With this, she was reminded that she had followed Gu Yuwu as well. She quickly clicked on her list of followers and took a screenshot of Gu Yuwu\u2019s name before she sent it to Gu Yuwu.\n[Lin Xiaowan: Are you busy? Hurry up and follow me!]\nGu Yuwu was likely busy so she did not reply for quite a while.\nLin Xiaowan waited for a while before she went to Gu Yuwu\u2019s page. Previously, she only looked at it briefly. Since she had nothing to do now, she took her time to see what was on Gu Yuwu\u2019s homepage. At this time, she also realized that every user s follower list was visible. With this, she quickly sent another message to Gu Yuwu.\nI Lin Xiaowan: Forget it, pretend I didn\u2019t say anything. Don\u2019t pay attention to me. ]\nGu Yuwu had a lot of followers, and they were not something Lin Xiaowan could compare to; they were in completely different leagues. Moreover, most of the people who followed Gu Yuwu had a certification mark next to their names, they were definitely not ordinary people.\nFor this reason, Lin Xiaowan felt that it was too abrupt to ask Gu Yuwu to follow her.\nLin Xiaowan curiously looked at Gu Yuwu\u2019s followers. She discovered that she did not know anyone. After all, the celebrities she knew were limited to those who acted in dramas and movies that she had watched.\nGu Yuwu had a lot of posts, and the latest one was a poll.\nLin Xiaowan took a look at the names of rhe celebrities in the poll and randomly voted for one. Although she did not know what it was about, she could roughly guess that Gu Yuwu was turning a novel into a movie. She had no interest in novels so she did not read the post carefully.\nAfter that post was a series of four photos of desserts. They were taken the day Gu Yuwu visited the dessert shop.\nGu Yuwu even captioned the photos.\n[I came to eat desserts at my sister\u2019s new dessert shop! If you mention my name, the boss will give you a discount! Consider this my treat! * laughing emoji J\n\nLin Xiaowan liked the post before she scrolled down.\nGu Yuwu reposted an article on the completion of the filming of the fantasy drama. She only used a simple thank you emoji to caption it.\nLin Xiaowan looked at the comments to see everyone\u2019s opinion of the drama.\n[Netizen 1: **** you! I\u2019ve had enough of the **** projects you chose! To think you dare to claim to be a producer! You\u2019re just so-so! You even dared to kick our queen out of the production team! What a ***!]\n[Gu Yuwu: Where did this animal come from? Why didn\u2019t your master tie you up properly? Get lost.]\nGu Yuwu also added an emoji of someone kicking another person with the text T*ckYou!\u2019.\n[Netizen i: F*ck you! Who do you think you are?! Do you really think our queen like your stupid drama?! You\u2019re a piece of shit! ]\n[Gu Yuwu: Have you seen the drama? Why are you so angry? If I\u2019m a piece of sh*t, what does it matter if she was kicked out of the production team? Don\u2019t be so angry now. Later, you\u2019ll have a real reason to be angry! ]\n[Netizen i: What right do you have to deprive our queen of acting? You\u2019re violating her personal freedom!]\n[Gu Yuwu: Oh, report it to the police then! I\n[Passerby 1: Hahahaha]\n[Passerby 2: Violating personal freedom! Hahaha! I\u2019m laughingout loud!]\n[Passerby 3: Who\u2019s that person\u2019s queen? I\u2019m curious\u2026]\nLin Xiaowan was shocked. She also could not figure out the words were replaced by ***. Apart from that, she was also curious about the identity of the queen\u2019 that was mentioned in the comment. After scrolling down a little, she finally found her answer.\n[Passerby 4:1 solved the mystery. Zhao Zihan was initially considered for one of the roles. However, she was arrogant because of her fame, was difficult to work with, and also did not listen to advice from the production team. As a result, she was kicked out!]\n[Passerby 5: Is that what happened? Hahaha! She was pretending to be so busy that she couldn\u2019t participate in the drama! As it turned out, she was kicked out! ]\n[Passerby 6: I\u2019m amused!]\n\nLin Xiaowan could not help but laugh as well.\nThere were other fans of celebrities that commented as well, recommending their favorite celebrities to Gu Yuwu.\nGu Yuwu also replied to a comment from a fan that said his or her favorite actress was beautiful, cute, and kind.\n[Gu Yuwu: Oh, but she has terrible acting skills. |\nGu Yuwu also replied to a comment from a fan who asked Gu Yuwu to give his or her idol a chance, saying he had unlimited potential and that he was still young.\n[Gu Yuwu: Young? He\u2019s 35 years old this year and has been in the industry for eight years! He wants to participate in my movies? Keep dreaming! ]\nMany people would also comment after Gu Yuwu commented.\nThis was the first time Lin Xiaowan had seen Gu Yuwu speaking venomously. It was very different from the Gu Yuwu she knew. However, she had to admit that this version of Gu Yuwu was very attractive and charming.\nWith this, she quickly sent another message to Gu Yuwu.\n[Lin Xiaowan: You\u2019re so charming when you scold people!]\nMeanwhile, Gu Yuwu was finally free. When she picked up her phone and read Lin Xiaowan\u2019s message, she paused for a moment before she tried to remedy the situation.\n[Gu Yuwu: Don\u2019t read! My image of a gentle and friendly sister is gone!]\n[Lin Xiaowan: Too late! It has turned into an imposing image! ]\nGu Yuwu was filled with the urge to make the posts with negative comments only visible to herself at this moment. She thought about it for a moment as she looked at her huge list of followers. Then, she sent Lin Xiaowan a message. [Gu Yuwu: What\u2019s your username? ]\n[Lin Xiaowan: I\u2019m Xiaowan!]\nGu Yuwu searched for Lin Xiaowan and discovered that Lin Xiaowan was following only two accounts.

Is it the entertainment industry?]\nGu Yuwu: Something like that. You can just treat it as the entertainment industry.]\nLin Xiaowan was completely unaware of Gu Yuwu\u2019s grief and indignation due to her character\u2019s collapse, and she was happily sending messages to Gu Yuwu.\n[Lin Xiaowan: Alright, I\u2019m going to dig up your history then! I\nAfter that, Lin Xiaowan went on Speaker again. She found Gu Yuwu\u2019s venomous tongue interesting. The latter was good at scolding people without going over rhe limit; she was like an expert. Moreover, this also showed how eloquent Gu Yuwu was. She was really impressed.\nin fact, Gu Yuwu had always been a tyrant in the entertainment industry. Even in the early days, her comments were filled with ***. Later on, she grew even more adept at scolding people and began to domineeringly crush the naysayers.\nMoreover, Gu Yuwu was not alone. Many of her followers were young girls. They were not just ordinary fans. They had been fans of idols for a long time so their combat ability online was very powerful.\nLin Xiaowan grew even more engrossed as she read the comments. Not only was the way they scolded people interesting, even the way they praised people was interesting.\n\n[Netizen 1: Sister Gu, are you single? I\u2019m the type that\u2019s easy on the eye. I may look ugly at first, but the more you look at me, the more good-looking you\u2019ll find me! You\u2019ll be blinded by love soon!

I\u2019ve not heard of it!]\nLin Xiaowan continued reading until the sky turned dark and Huo Zheng came home. When she saw him, she ran into his arms immediately.\nHuo Zheng hugged her and said, \u201cBe careful. What if you fall?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan laughed and asked, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you look at the road when you walk?\u201d\nHuo Zheng raised an eyebrow in confusion. \u201cWho doesn\u2019t look at the road?\u20191\n\u201cIf you look at the road, how could you have bumped into\u2026 my heart!\u201d\nHuo Zheng was briefly stunned. When he recovered his senses, he laughed. After a while, he said, \u201cSister-in-law called me earlier to look for you. She said that she couldn\u2019t get through to you.\u201d\n\u201cHuh? I was charging my phone earlier so I didn\u2019t hear it.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan still hung on Huo Zheng like a koala bear as he walked into the walk-in wardrobe. He placed her on the couch at the side before he removed his jacket and tie.\n\u201cWhy was Sister-in-law looking for me?\u201d\n\nHuo Zheng took out a set of casual clothes as he replied, \u201cThere\u2019ll be a birthday party soon, and she wants me to bring you along\u2026\u201d\nin fact, Huo Zheng had summarized what Qian You\u2019an said. What Qiao You\u2019an meant was that everyone wanted to meet Lin Xiaowan and was curious about her. It was not good for him to keep hiding her from everyone. After the dessert shop opened for business, she had become quite a hot topic in the circle. Everyone had heard of her, but they had yet to meet her. As such, their expectations rose. Moreover, those few women who met her before would praise her to the sky, malting the others even more curious.\nThis was normal. It was difficult for those to marry into wealthy families to keep a low profile after all.\nAlthough Qiao You\u2019an had repeatedly emphasized that Huo Zheng and Lin Xiaowan were not married yet, saying it was normal for young couples to stay lowkey, many people still felt that the couple had secretly registered their marriage. There were even rumors that it was an arranged marriage that was set up long ago and that there was no love between the couple. They thought that this was rhe reason Huo Zheng did not bring Lin Xiaowan out.\nQiao You\u2019an was both angry and amused when she heard the rumors. She tried explaining initially, but in the end, she was too lazy to bother with them.\n\u201cBirthday party? Whose birthday party? Sister-in-law?\u201d\n\u201cNo. He could be considered a good friend in the circle. His surname is Bai, and their family deals with electronics,\u201d Huo Zheng said, explaining it as best as he could.\n\u201cUh,\u201d Lin Xiaowan replied, showing that she did not know the other party.\nHuo Zheng\u2019s hand that was unbuttoning his shirt suddenly paused. He looked at the woman who was curled up on the couch, watching him with sparkling eyes. He asked in a low voice, \u201cAre you sure you want to watch me change?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan did not think much of it at first, but upon hearing his words, she quickly rose to her feet and glared at him reproachfully before she ran away. If she stayed, something might happen.\nAfter Huo Zheng changed his clothes and walked out, Lin Xiaowan continued their previous topic. She said seriously, \u201cI don\u2019t want to go. There\u2019ll be many people among the guests who have visited the dessert shop. If I go, won\u2019t they recognize me?\u201d\nMost importantly, she had gotten her employees to lie that she was just a friend\u2019 of Lin Xiaowan helping our at the shop. If she attended the birthday party, would her lie not be exposed?\nLin Xiaowan sighed heavily. As expected, a lie would need more lies to cover it up.\n\u201cDon\u2019t go then,\u201d Huo Zheng said. He did not think the birthday party was a big deal, but there was something else. He continued to say, \u201cThe daughter from the Bai family really likes the desserts from your shop so she wanted to ask if your shop would cater for the party?\u201d\nBai Xinting has a strange prejudice against Zhu Yingyue so she did not want to get in touch with the latter. However, she could not get in contact with Lin Xiaowan. She tried sending Lin Xiaowan a message on Speaker, but the message was left unread. She did nor dare to rashly look for the fierce Second Master Huo\u2019s wife so she looked for Qiao You\u2019an first.\nHuo Zheng added, \u201cSister-in-law said that she particularly likes the French desserts made by one of your patissiers.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan could not make the decision on her own so she said, \u2019\u2019I\u2019ll speak to that patissier tomorrow before I call Sister-in-law..\u201d\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

Although the patissier was not a native of Shangxia, he was very fluent in its language so there was no barrier in communication.\nUpon hearing Lin Xiaowan\u2019s request, he smiled, revealing the wrinkles on his forehead, as he asked, \u201cSure. When do I have to be there?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan had asked about this yesterday. The party was on Friday night the week after next. If the patissier agreed to go, the shop would have to close early in the afternoon. However, she did not mind it.\nLin Xiaowan texted Zhu Yingyue, asking if she could borrow the patissier for a day.\n[Zhu Yingyue: Do whatever you want. You can make decisions yourself. Just let me know about it.]\nZhu Yingyue was also very easygoing.\nThe patissier from Lin Xiaowan\u2019s shop was not the only one who was hired. After all, it was a huge banquet, and they would need a lot of desserts.\nBefore the birthday party, Lin Xiaowan followed the patissier there to have a look out of curiosity.\nBai Xinting enthusiastically showed everyone the kitchen they would be working in and showed them the banquet menu as well. She also took the initiative to assign 16 helpers to Lin Xiaowan\u2019s patissier. After all, Lin Xiaowan only gave her patissier an assistant.\nWhat made Lin Xiaowan feel even more embarrassed was the fact that she had met Bai Xinting before. Bai Xinting was the beautiful woman whom she had met at the stairwell in the dessert shop previously. At that time, she had lied to Bai Xinting.\nHowever, Bai Xinting did not seem angry. Instead, she said with a gentle smile, \u201cAs expected, you\u2019re Lin Xiaowan.\u201d\n\nLin Xiaowan was so embarrassed that she did not know what to say. She laughed before she explained earnestly, \u201c1 didn\u2019t mean to lie. 1 was just trying to avoid trouble.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I understand,\u201d Bai Xinting said. She was very understanding.\n\u2018Is it really okay?\u2019\nLin Xiaowan remained silent. Bai Xinting was smiling so warmly at her that she felt even more embarrassed and guilty. For this reason, she somehow promised Bai Xinting in a daze that she would attend the birthday party. She could not refuse the other party and could only laugh stiffly and said, \u201cOf course, I\u2019ll attend the party.\u201d\nAs soon as Lin Xiaowan left, she began to hesitate and regret her decision. When she saw Huo Zheng, she asked for his opinion.\n\u201cJust do what you want. It doesn\u2019t matter if you don\u2019t go,\u201d Huo Zheng said. Then, he thought of a sentence he had read before but disagreed with. However, he felt that he could use it now to reassure Lin Xiaowan so he said, \u201cMost agreements between adults are just perfunctory.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan looked at him skeptically as she asked, \u201cThen, are your agreements with CEO Li, CEO Wang, CEO Zhao, and the other CEOs perfunctory?\u201d\nHuo Zheng was rendered speechless. Naturally, those agreements were not perfunctory. Moreover, people in his position hated going back on their words or making casual promises.\nSometimes, one might speak casually, but the listener might take it seriously. If one did not watch one\u2019s words when speaking, it would be easy to make mistakes.\nHuo Zheng tried his best to defend himself. \u201cThe situation is different.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan did not want to attend the birthday party because she knew she had to watch her words and actions very carefully. It was uncomfortable and tiring. Another reason for her reluctance was the lie she told at the dessert shop.\nLin Xiaowan looked a little depressed as she snuggled into Huo Zheng\u2019s arms and said, \u201cI have something to tell you\u2026\u201d\n\u201cHmm?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan told Huo Zheng about how she had lied about being someone else when asked.\n\n\u201cWhy did you do that?\u201d Huo Zheng laughed.\n\u201cI just blurted it out without thinking back then\u2026\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay. You don\u2019t have to worry or feel embarrassed. It\u2019s just a harmless joke,\u201d Huo Zheng said. He did not think it was a big deal at all, but seeing how worried she was, he asked, \u201cWould it be better if 1 accompany you?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan knew Huo Zheng rarely attended such events. The events he attended were usually very formal where they discussed business cooperation. Therefore, she did not expect him to go with her.\nLin Xiaowan put her thumb and index finger together before she said, \u201cI feel just a tiny bit better\u2026\u201d\nHuo Zheng laughed and did not say anything seeing that she was in a better mood.\nA few days before the birthday party, Lin Xiaowan\u2019s custom brooch finally arrived. It looked even more exquisite and beautiful than the photos that the designer had sent her.\nAfter processing, the seashell\u2019s patterns were even more obvious. The embedded gemstones also set off the seashell beautifully. She excitedly showed it to him, saying that it was her gift to him.\nWhen Huo Zheng accompanied Lin Xiaowan to attend the Bai family\u2019s birthday party, he wore the brooch. To match the brooch, he wore a light blue shirt. Ever since he had taken over Huo Corporation, he had rarely dressed in light colors. Perhaps that was why he was even more eye-catching than the head of the Bai family today.\nLin Xiaowan, on the other hand, wore a light pink dress. The two of them looked like a match made in heaven.\nWith Lin Xiaowan around, everyone could see that Huo Zheng was in a good mood.\nWhen the couple handed the gift to the butler, Lin Xiaowan could clearly see the butler\u2019s probing gaze. She straightened her back and boldly met his gaze. She was much more courageous than before, especially after she started working at the dessert shop.\nAlthough she was still nervous on social occasions like this, she was still able to act confidently.\nAfter a while, Lin Xiaowan whispered to the man next to her, \u201cIt seems like many people are looking at you\u2026\u201d\nHuo Zheng adjusted her hair ornament and replied, \u201cThey\u2019re also looking at you.\u201d\nWhen he saw Lin Xiaowan\u2019s tense expression and her eyes darting around, he asked, \u201cAre you very nervous?\u201d\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

I don\u2019t feel that nervous,\u201d Lin Xiaowan said proudly, \u201cI\u2019ll just look at whoever looks at me, and make them feel embarrassed.\n\u201cAlright.\u201d Huo Zheng laughed.\nThe birthday party was actually rather boring, but there were many delicacies.\nHuo Zheng held a plate and followed Lin Xiaowan. When he saw her picking something up, he would move the plate over at the right time.\nLin Xiaowan took a bite of the cheese berry tart before she gave a small piece to Huo Zheng and said, \u201cThis was made by my patissier.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t really like desserts,\u201d Huo Zheng said. Despite his words, he still held her hand and lowered his head to put the cheese berry tart into his mouth. \u201cDidn\u2019t you say you don\u2019t like it? Then why are you eating it?\u201d Lin Xiaowan said sarcastically. Then, she warned, \u201cBe careful. There might be poison on the spoon.\u201d\nHuo Zheng felt that Lin Xiaowan was not very smart. Amused, he asked, \u201cThen did you test the poison for me earlier?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan could not react for a moment. Indeed, she had taken a bit of the tart first. If there was poison, she would be the first to be poisoned.\n\u2018Damn it!\u2019\n\u201cEat less. You have an appointment with the dentist in a few days.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan had only been eating desserts. Huo Zheng could not understand why she loved sweet things so much. Now that she opened a dessert shop, she had been eating them every day. Even then, it was not enough.\nHuo Zheng sounded like a nagging father as he continued to say, \u201cYou have to eat more vegetables and fruits to be healthy.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not unhealthy though?\u201d Lin Xiaowan glanced at him and counted with her fingers as she said, \u201cI ate grapefruit, watermelon, and honeydew today. 1 also ate a lot of vegetables for lunch.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan had fried chicken for lunch today.\n\nHuo Zheng was silent for a moment, wondering if the vegetable she was referring to was the small portion of lettuce next to the fried chicken that was more like a garnish.\n\u201cCome and have lunch with me tomorrow,\u201d Huo Zheng said.\nThe dessert shop was close to the Huo Corporation; it was only a ten-minute walk away. It was not impossible for them to have lunch together if Lin Xiaowan was willing.\nHowever, Lin Xiaowan was unwilling. She said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan wanted to eat whatever she wanted. She could not allow someone to ruin her happy time! If she ate by herself, she could drink milk tea and fruit juice at the same time. After her meal, there were also many desserts for her to choose from. She was simply too happy. Could she eat like that if Huo Zheng was around? Of course not.\nFinally, someone approached Huo Zheng to talk to him. The other party held a champagne flute and bowed slightly before he said with a smile, \u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since Second Master Huo attended an event like this. Why did you suddenly attend Old Bai\u2019s birthday party today?\u201d\nToday\u2019s birthday party was in honor of the head of the Bai family. He was in his fifties and had started his company from scratch. Others would always praise him when they mentioned him. He was bold and knew how to seize opportunities. Alas, although he was outstanding, he still could not compare to Huo Zheng. They were in completely different leagues.\nHuo Zheng looked at the other party silently. It was obvious he did not want to talk to the other party.\nLin Xiaowan bit her spoon as she watched. Seeing Huo Zheng\u2019s blatant disregard for the other person, she even felt that Huo Zheng was too arrogant.\nOn the other hand, the man did not look annoyed at being ignored. Instead, he smiled and continued to ask, \u201cWho\u2019s this person next to you?\u201d\nThe man already had a guess in his heart, but he still asked such a question. Just as expected, Huo Zheng did not ignore this question.\nAlthough Huo Zheng looked aloof, he could barely hide the gentleness in his voice as he said, \u201cMy wife.\u201d\nWith this, the man said flatteringly, \u201cNo wonder. Both of you look like a match made in heaven! You really look good together.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan choked before she corrected, \u201cWe\u2019re not married yet.\u201d\nThe man paused for a fleeting moment. However, he was quite quick-witted. He said, \u201cYou\u2019re not even married yet, but you look like you\u2019re married. This means that your relationship is very good! In my opinion, after you get married, your days will definitely be full of love and prosperity.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan knew the words the other party said, but when she strung them together, she found them incoherent.\nHuo Zheng looked at the man in front of him and said with a faint smile, \u201cThank you for your auspicious words.\u201d\n\nThe man holding the champagne flute was very observant. Seeing that Huo Zheng was no longer as aloof as before, he put down his glass and brought his business card out, respectfully handing it to Huo Zheng. He was also very tactful. Although he wanted to get close to Huo Zheng for work-related matters, he did not talk about work at all. He said, \u201cThis is my contact information. If I\u2019m lucky enough to attend Second Master Huo\u2019s wedding in the future, I\u2019ll definitely remember it for the rest of my life. I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be a grand wedding to remember, filled with love and sincerity.\u201d\nHuo Zheng looked at the man silently. The man had been bowing from the beginning until now.\nMeanwhile, Lin Xiaowan could not hold back and burped after she drank the orange juice too quickly.\nAt the same time, Huo Zheng took the business card and placed it on the small table in front of him without looking at it. Instead, he looked at Lin Xiaowan and patted her back gently as he said in a gentle but reproachful tone, \u201cDrink slowly. Don\u2019t drink anymore after this.\u201d\nIn front of outsiders, Lin Xiaowan was too embarrassed to act coquettishly and ask for more. Before she lowered her head to eat the chocolate cake in front of her, she stiffly replied, \u201cOh.\u201d\nHuo Zheng picked up the business card he had just put aside. When he looked up again, his gentleness when faced with Lin Xiaowan was gone. He said expressionlessly to the man, \u201cYou\u2019re quite eloquent.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan did not understand the meaning behind these words; she only thought Huo Zheng was praising the man. She quietly watched as the middle-aged man straightened his back and smiled.\nOverjoyed, the man raised his glass and said, \u201cThankyou, Second Master!\u201d\nHuo Zheng nodded silently.\nThe man had achieved his goal, and he knew he should stop while he was ahead. He knew that if he stayed any longer, he would only be annoying. Hence, he quickly said before he left, \u201cThen 1 won\u2019t disturb Second Master Huo any longer.\u201d\nAs soon as the other party left, Lin Xiaowan leaned against Huo Zheng and asked curiously, \u201cWhy does he look so happy?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Huo Zheng replied with a straight face.\nLin Xiaowan looked at Huo Zheng skeptically. She suspected that he was lying, but she had no proof.\n\u201cAre you done eating?\u201d Huo Zheng asked, picking up the plate and preparing to stand up.\nUpon seeing this, Lin Xiaowan quickly grabbed his arm and shook her head. \u201cNo, no, no.\u201d\nAfter that, she said, \u201cThat person from before often comes to the dessert shop as well, and he had seen me before. However, he did not say anything earlier\u2026\u201d\nThis was what a smart person would do.\nThe man had already seen through Lin Xiaowan\u2019s \u2018friend\u2019 at the dessert shop as the Second Madam of the Huo family. However, he knew exposing her would only make things awkward so he wisely pretended not to know her at all. He was quite capable.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about him..\u201d\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

Second Master Huo looked much more amiable than usual. Teach me.\u201d\nThe man smiled mysteriously and did not say anything.\nThere were guests who had visited the dessert shop before. The observant ones had long noticed that the person next to Huo Zheng was the person who had been helping out at the shop.\n\u201cWho\u2019s that woman next to him?\u201d\nThe man glanced at everyone and smiled before he said politely, \u201cThere\u2019s only one person whom Second Master Huo would bring here\u2026\u201d\nThe others naturally understood the meaning of these words.\n\nAmong these few people, the person who was most anxious earlier wore a dissatisfied expression on his face as he said unhappily, \u201c1 knew she wasn\u2019t just a simple helper at the shop! Who does she think she is to act so arrogant? Isn\u2019t she just relying on the Huo family to act that way?\u201d\nUpon hearing this, the man, who had just successfully handed his business card to Huo Zheng and seemed to have left a good impression on Huo Zheng, did not change his expression, but he skillfully distanced himself from the other party. A person who spoke without thinking would get into trouble sooner or later. There was no need for him to befriend the other party.\nAfter giving his speech, the head of the Bai family also came over to speak to Huo Zheng. To be honest, he did not expect that his daughter would be able to invite Huo Zheng to his party. He raised his glass and toasted Huo Zheng, finishing it in one gulp before he said, \u201cSecond Master Huo, thank you for coming today.\u201d\nHuo Zheng\u2019s appearance at this birthday party would definitely make things easy for him in the future when he was networking. For this reason, despite being the star of the party, he took the initiative to come to see Huo Zheng.\nThe head of the Bai family\u2019s appearance and temperament were very different. His face looked gentle, and his skin and lips were slightly pale. He looked like a weak and frail young master in ancient dramas. He did not look his age at all. Although he was in his fifties, he did not look much older than a man in his thirties. He took very good care of his appearance.\nAfter a brief moment, he raised his glass and looked at Xiaowan before he asked, \u201cThis must be Second Master Huo\u2019s wife, right?\nHuo Zheng looked at Lin Xiaowan as though he was asking silently with his eyes, \u201cHow are you going to reply?\u201d\nHuo Zheng had been refuted by her earlier so he did not rush to respond this time.\nLin Xiaowan cleared her throat awkwardly before she said, \u201cWe\u2019re not married yet.\u201d\nThen, as though she was worried Huo Zheng would misunderstand, she quickly added, \u201cBut we\u2019ll get married in the future.\u201d\nHowever, as soon as Lin Xiaowan finished speaking, she felt that her words were inappropriate.\n\nUpon hearing this, the head of the Bai family\u2019s eyes flashed slightly. He praised her before he asked to attend the wedding in the future. He could tell that Huo Zheng did not object to her words. He also did not continue on this topic. He only raised an eyebrow slightly and said, \u201cSecond Master Huo\u2019s wedding will definitely be incomparably grand in the future.\u201d\nAfter that, he did not beat around the bush and said directly, \u201c1 really didn\u2019t expect Second Master Huo to come today. It\u2019s my honor to be able to speak to you. If you need any partners to cooperate with in the future, I sincerely hope that you\u2019ll give small families like us a chance. I\u2019ll be eternally grateful to you.\u201d\nHis words and tone were very pleasant to the ears. He made a small request in such a relaxed manner. It was as though if Huo Zheng was willing to help him, he\u2019ll accept it. If Huo Zheng was not willing, he also would not pester Huo Zheng.\nLin Xiaowan looked at Huo Zheng.\nHuo Zheng\u2019s expression did not betray his thoughts. He only nodded and said in a deep voice, \u201cMaster Bai, you\u2019re too polite.\u201d\nAfter that, the head of the Bai family left with his personal assistant to chat with the other guests.\nMeanwhile, Lin Xiaowan noticed that although no one approached them, most of them were pretending to pass by, trying to eavesdrop on them. She said to Huo Zheng, \u201cDo you know when they address you as Second Master Huo, 1 feel like I\u2019ve gone back in time by a few hundred years. You\u2019re just like a feudal lord.\u201d\nApart from that, Lin Xiaowan felt that the title \u2018Second Master Huo\u2019 made him seem decades older.\n\u2018Ah, it really doesn\u2019t sound good\u2026\u2019\nAfter a moment, she asked, \u201cDon\u2019t tell that when Elder Brother comes out to socialize, everyone addresses him as Master or Eldest Master?\u201d\n\u201cMm,\u201d Huo Zheng replied with a nod..\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

He was very busy with work and rarely participated in social gatherings. Qiao You\u2019an was the one responsible for the Huo family\u2019s external relations. On the rare occasion when Htio Cheng had time, he would accompany his wife.\nLin Xiaowan imagined that if Huo Cheng was here with Huo Zheng today, everyone would toast them and bow respectfully as they called out, \u201cMaster Huo, Second Master Huo!\u201d\nLin Xiaowan found it very strange.\nLin Xiaowan and Huo Zheng did not plan to stay for long. After speaking to the head of the Bai family, they were ready to leave.\nWhen they walked to the garden in front, Lin Xiaowan saw Cheng Ruitong talking to someone. The other party, whose head was lowered like a quail, seemed to be an assistant or secretary. All in all, the duo\u2019s expressions did not seem too good at this moment.\nCheng Ruitong also did not expect to run into Lin Xiaowan here. She was briefly stunned. When she recovered, she adjusted her expression and took a deep breath. After that, she called out, \u201cXiaowan.11\nThe other party, who was being reprimanded after making a mistake earlier, did not even dare to breathe loudly. Although he was a grown man, he felt like he was going to cry from being scolded. He was slightly curious when he heard that his boss\u2019 wife had become less cold. As such, he snuck a glance to see who the other person was. No matter who it was, he felt extremely grateful.\nWhen Cheng Ruitong scolded someone, there was no fluctuation in her tone as well. However, it was this lack of fluctuation that made her scary. It was as though the other party was going to be dismissed and kicked out like trash in the next moment, unable to see the sun again.\nAt this moment, Huo Zheng had walked away to answer a work call.\n\u201cAm I disturbing you?\u201d\u2018 Lin Xiaowan asked hesitantly.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Cheng Ruitong said before she glanced at her employee, whom she thought was dumb, and decided to let him off for now. She said, \u201cCorrect your mistakes. 1 want to see the amended work tomorrow.\u201d\n\nThe employee felt as though he had been pardoned. He could not react for a while, stunned.\nIs she going to let me off just like this?\u201d\nHe sighed in relief inwardly before he said, \u201cYes.\u201d\nCheng Ruitong warned coldly, \u201cIf you make such a low-level mistake again, your position will be given to another person.\u201d\n\u201cThere won\u2019t be a next time. Don\u2019t worry, President Cheng. I admit this was my mistake so please deduct my salary this month,\u201d the employee said. He was not unwilling at all. To be fair, although the work could sometimes be difficult and time-consuming, it was pretty good to work for Cheng Ruitong.\nAlthough Cheng Ruitong was aloof and taciturn, she was very easy to talk to most of the time. Unless one crossed the line, most of the time the employees would only be reprimanded and punished fairly if they made a mistake. However, it had to be said that Cheng Ruitong was very scary when she was reprimanding her employees.\nMost importantly, Cheng Ruitong paid her employees well. Naturally, it was also because of their capabilities that they were paid well.\nUpon hearing her employee\u2019s humble words, Cheng Ruitong frowned slightly and said, \u201cNo need.\u201d\nThe employee still wanted to insist, but when he saw the annoyance and impatience in his boss\u2019 eyes and the young woman standing at the side, he felt like his presence was quite redundant. In the end, he decided it was best for him to leave immediately and work overtime to correct his mistake.\nBefore leaving, he snuck a look at the fairy-like woman who had saved him, but when he had a good look, he exclaimed in surprise. He had seen her before. In the end, he could not help but ask, \u201cYou\u2019re the employee from the dessert shop?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan did not expect the other party to recognize her. She said, \u201cYes\u2026\u201d \u201cI see. Your desserts are really too delicious! My wife and daughter love them! They say that your dessert shop is the best in Sheng]ing,\u201d the employee said. He was actually a loyal customer.\nThe employee sighed as he continued to say, \u201cMy wife often laments the fact that your dessert shop doesn\u2019t do delivery. She said that your business would be even better if you did that.\u201d\nIndeed, although it was a little troublesome, the dessert shop\u2019s business would be even better if they provided delivery service. However, the patissiers were already very busy. If they offered delivery service as well, the patissiers would be very tired. Moreover, they did not lack profit. In short, Zhu Yingyue felt that it was unnecessary.\nLin Xiaowan was very warm and friendly when faced with customers who simply liked the desserts and had no ulterior motives. As such, she explained the situation a little to the employee.\n\nThe employee expressed his understanding, and just as he was about to speak again, he noticed his boss\u2019 expression had gradually darkened. With that, he immediately said goodbye and ran off.\n\u2018That was a life-or-death moment! My life is more important than desserts!\u2019\n\u201cIt\u2019s so late, but you\u2019re still dealing with work matters,\u201d Lin Xiaowan said. At the same time, she thought to herself, It\u2019s really not easy being a big boss. Huo Zheng\u2019s the same. He\u2019s always busy dealing with all kinds of things.\u2019\nCheng Ruitong replied, \u201cIt was an emergency. He made a mistake at work.\u201d\nCheng Ruitong s tone softened a lot when she spoke to Lin Xiaowan. However, her face was still expressionless. Many people were afraid of her because of this and assumed she was very arrogant, bur this was not the case at ail.\nAfter a moment, Cheng Ruitong added, \u201cI haven\u2019t had the time to visit your shop, but my assistant bought the desserts for me a few times. They were delicious.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan was a little surprised. Previously, Cheng Ruitong had sent a gift through her friend during the opening ceremony. She had sent a message to express her gratitude and did not have any contact with Cheng Ruitong after that. She assumed that Cheng Ruitong did not like desserts. She had once suspected this was a commonality between CEOs and presidents; they did not like sweet things.\n\u201cOh, you should\u2019ve told me! I would\u2019ve sent you more,\u201d Lin Xiaowan said. Then, a hint of complaint could be heard in her voice as she continued to say, \u201cI sent you a message before, but you didn\u2019t reply. I thought you didn\u2019t like desserts.\u201d\nCheng Ruitong did not have any impression of this so she brought her phone out to have a look. Indeed, Lin Xiaowan had sent her messages.\n[Lin Xiaowan: I\u2019ve received your gift! Thank you!]\nI Lin Xiaowan: Also, I\u2019ve received the perfume your friend made! I tried it out! It\u2019s really fragrant, and I really like it! ]\nApart from that, Lin Xiaowan also sent two photos to accompany the messages.\nSeeing that the messages were sent quite a while ago, Cheng Ruitong said apologetically, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I was very busy that day. 1 probably forgot about them because I didn\u2019t reply immediately.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan hurriedly said, \u2019 It\u2019s okay, it\u2019s okay. There\u2019s no need to say sorry. This is a very, very small matter..\u201d\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

She was a sensitive person, after all. When Cheng Ruitong did not reply to her messages, she did not dare to ask any questions or send another message since they were not very familiar with each other. However, she would secretly wonder if she had something wrong that made Cheng Ruitong dislike her.\nNaturally, if it was someone she was familiar with like Huo Zheng, she would pester him, ask him why he did not reply, and if he was working. She would even joke with him.\nIf she did not meet Cheng Ruitong by chance today and mustered up her courage to ask about it, they would likely lose contact.\n\u201cAre you still learning archery?\u201d Cheng Ruitong asked before she said, \u201c1 have free time in two days. Do you want to go to the club with me?\u201d\n\u201cYes, but my performance isn\u2019t very good. 1 still can\u2019t hit the target,\u201d Lin Xiaowan said, feeling slightly embarrassed as she said these words, \u201cOf course, I want to go with you if you have free time!\u201d\nCheng Ruitong nodded expressionlessly. However, inwardly, she thought that it was so good to speak to a soft and beautiful girl.\nAt this time, Huo Zheng finally returned. When he could not find Lin Xiaowan in her original position, he looked around briefly before he saw her. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan said happily, \u201cI saw Sister Cheng so I came over to say hello.\u201d\nWhen faced with the opposite sex, Cheng Ruitong was the same. She was aloof and expressionless. She said politely, \u201cPresident Huo, long time no see.\u201d\nHuo Zheng nodded in response. After all, they had cooperated before. He also knew Cheng Ruitong\u2019s usual style very well so he did not bother to be polite. He held Lin Xiaowan\u2019s hand and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan allowed him to hold her hand. She waved at Cheng Ruitong with her other hand and said, \u201cSister Cheng, 1\u201911 leave first!\u201d\nCheng Ruitong nodded. \u201cBye, Xiaowan. I\u2019ll see you next time!\u201d\nLin Xiaowan smiled sincerely. \u201cAlright!\u201d\nAfter parting ways, Huo Zheng asked teasingly in a low voice, \u201cDid you secretly make an appointment behind my back?\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t do it secretly! You were busy earlier,\u201d Lin Xiaowan said righteously, \u201cMoreover, don\u2019t you know about it now?\u201d\n\n\u201cSister Cheng? You address her so intimately,\u201d Huo Zheng said as he opened the car door for Lin Xiaowan. After they both got into the car, he added, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you call me Brother any more?\u201d\n\u201cBecause I don\u2019t want to!\u201d Lin Xiaowan said, making a face at him and sticking her tongue out.\nSubsequently, Huo Zheng kissed her.\nWhen Lin Xiaowan got out of the car, she was dizzy. She could not even differentiate between north, south, east, and west. Her legs were weak, and she was carried into the house by her boyfriend in the posture one would carry a child.\nLin Xiaowan wrapped her arms around Huo Zheng\u2019s neck and expressed her displeasure. \u201cIn the dramas, the CEOs and the presidents would carry their girlfriends like princesses. Why do you carry me like this?\u201d\nHe held her bottom with one and supported her back with the other. He raised his eyebrow and asked, \u201cDidn\u2019t you jump into my arms like that?\u201d\n\u201cNo!\u201d Lin Xiaowan denied.\nHuo Zheng was magnanimous and did not argue with her. No matter what, she was always right.\nBefore going to bed, Lin Xiaowan thought of something and asked worriedly, \u201cDoes this mean that 1 can no longer work at the dessert shop?\u201d\nAlthough no one dared to approach her tonight, there must be guests like the tactful man who recognized her from the dessert shop. Even if there were not many who recognized her, it would not take long before word of it spread to everyone.\n\u201cYou can do whatever you want,\u201d Huo Zheng said reassuringly, \u201cIf you click with someone, it\u2019s not a bad idea to befriend them. If someone makes you feel uncomfortable, you can just ignore them.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan thought about it for a moment before she shook her head and said, \u201cForget it. I\u2019ll take a few days off. Maybe after things settle down, they\u2019ll forget about it\u2026\u201d\nAfter that, Lin Xiaowan showed Huo Zheng her homepage on Speaker and said, \u201cLook! There are so many people following me. 1 wonder if all of them are trying to get close to you?\u201d\nHuo Zheng took a look and said, \u201cI don\u2019t think more than a thousand people are following you just because of me\u2026 You should be more confident. They\u2019re following you because of you.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan locked her phone and said skeptically, \u201cBut I have nothing, they have no reason to follow me\u2026\u201d\nAfter putting her phone aside, she cupped her face with both hands before she said with a cheeky smile, \u201cOh, wait, 1 do have something. 1 have beauty!\u201d\nHuo Zheng hugged her, amused.\nA few days later, Cheng Ruitong kept her word and invited Lin Xiaowan out.\n\nLin Xiaowan had not been to the dessert shop over the past few days and had been cooped up at home. She had been feeling bored so she agreed quickly.\nCheng Ruitong was dressed in a simple white shirt and black pants, and her hair was pulled up into a high ponytail. When she saw Lin Xiaowan, she smiled and opened the passenger seat door for her. When Lin Xiaowan got into the car, she said, filled with praise, \u201cYour outfit looks cute.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan wore a straw hat with a large light green bow. She wore a cream V-neck shirt and matching pants. She looked very lively and energetic.\nWhen Lin Xiaowan casually placed her bag in the back seat, it caught Cheng Ruitong\u2019s eye, and she asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s that? A frog?\u201d\nThe dark green leather bag was small. It was clearly not functional, and it was more of a decorative piece. At most, it could hold a mobile phone.\n\u201cNo, I was told it\u2019s a small crocodile!\u201d Lin Xiaowan fastened her seatbelt before she looked at Cheng Ruitong expectantly as she asked with a smile, \u201cIsn\u2019t it cute?\u201d\nCheng Ruitong avoided Lin Xiaowan\u2019s eyes as she replied, \u201cMm.\u201d\nIt was in fact rather ugly.\nBefore she drove, Cheng Ruitong glanced at the bag again.\n\u2018Forget it. It\u2019s not that ugly. Looking at it closely, it\u2019s quite\u2026 cute\u2026\u2019\nCheng Ruitong asked, \u201cWhere did you get this from?\u201d\n\u2018Is it okay to sell such a bag? Was she cheated?\u2019\nLin Xiaowan replied, \u201cIt\u2019s from Saint Laurent. This is a limited-edition gift. The salesperson said there were also a bear and a frog. 1 want them all. She said she\u2019ll give them to me next time. Do you want one as well?\u201d\n\u2018So it\u2019s a gift\u2026 That\u2019s right. They wouldn\u2019t be able to sell it anyway. It\u2019s better to give it away\u2026\u2019\nCheng Ruitong shook her head and said, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t.\u201d\nCheng Ruitong felt that she had refused too quickly so she added, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t suit me.\u201d\nCheng Ruitong had always dressed very simply. This kind of decorative bag needed to be carefully matched or else it would look very out of place.\nLin Xiaowan did not think much of it and nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d\nIndeed, it did not match Cheng Ruitong\u2019s style..\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

She was clearly a regular here. As soon as she walked in, a well-dressed man greeted her warmly and asked what she wanted to do today.\nCheng Ruitong nodded before she said, \u201cThere\u2019s no need to call anyone today.\u201d\nUsually, when Cheng Ruitong came, someone would be at her beck and call. Sometimes, the other person would even accompany her to experience the thrill of racing. There was a specially approved racing track on the winding mountain road behind the club. Safety measures were naturally taken.\nThe two women went to the archery range first.\nLin Xiaowan only tried archery once. After the first time, she no longer had any contact with it. She had forgotten everything she had learned.\n\u201cHave you forgotten the movements I taught you?\u201d Cheng Ruitong asked, patting Lin Xiaowan\u2019s shoulder.\nAfter that, Cheng Ruitong patiently taught Lin Xiaowan the correct posture, how to exert her strength, and how to aim at the target. Although she was expressionless, her tone was kind.\nWith Cheng Ruitong\u2019s guidance, Lin Xiaowan pulled her hand back and released the arrow. With a swoosh, it hit the target. Although it was mostly due to Cheng Ruitong\u2019s help, she was still delighted and proud. After all, it was her first time hitting the target.\n\u201cWow! This is amazing!\u201d\nIt was unknown if she was praising others or herself.\nCheng Ruitong let go of Lin Xiaowan and said, \u201cTry it yourself.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan adjusted her posture again and took aim. With a swoosh, the arrow was released. After a short while, it fell to the ground weakly. Without Cheng Ruitong\u2019s help, the arrow she shot could not even touch the target.\nLin Xiaowan puffed her cheeks up and said, \u201cThere must be a problem with the arrow. I did everything correctly.\u201d\nEverything was done perfectly, and yet, she still could not touch the target. The problem must be with the arrow, not her.\nCheng Ruitong could not hide her smile at all. \u201cWell, let\u2019s try again. The arrow earlier has a problem\u2026\u201d\n\nThe arrows were all mass-produced. How could there be anything wrong with them? Moreover, many people had used them without complaints. Cheng Ruitong\u2019s words were nothing more than to coax Lin Xiaowan.\nLin Xiaowan was also easy to coax. With just a few words, she would be happy.\nAfter that, Lin Xiaowan fired a few shots consecutively but still failed to touch the target.\nBefore Lin Xiaowan could say anything, Cheng Ruitong said expressionlessly, \u201cIt\u2019s the arrow\u2019s fault. They\u2019re too light.\u201d\nWhen Lin Xiaowan\u2019s arrow finally touched the target, Cheng Ruitong said with a straight face, \u201cXiaowan, you\u2019re progressing very quickly. Other people have to come a few times before they can even hit the target.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan felt satisfied with her progress today and pestered Cheng Ruitong to play a few more rounds.\nThe venue was cold and quiet, but at this time, a few people came in, making the place livelier. They were all young people, and based on their conversation, it seemed like they were here to complete and place bets.\nThere was an electronic board at the side that displayed the time of the match and the players\u2019 scores.\nLin Xiaowan had seen one of the people who came in before on the Internet. He was a wealthy young master and was famous for being a womanizer. He was not a celebrity, but he had a lot of followers online. It was rumored that he had an affair with all the women around him. In short, she did not have a good impression of the other party.\nThe other party\u2019s hair was dyed golden brown and carefully styled. He wore a gaudy flower shirt and left a few of his buttons unbuttoned, exposing his tan chest.\nLin Xiaowan hurriedly looked away after a moment.\nA few of them knew Cheng Ruitong so they came over to greet her respectfully.\nCheng Ruitong was not enthusiastic. She nodded in response but did not say much.\nThe womanizing young master, a son of a real estate tycoon, recognized Lin Xiaowan. He was also present at the Bai family\u2019s birthday party. He could not help but ask Cheng Ruitong, \u201cShe\u2019s from the Huo family, right?\u201d\nSeeing that the other party recognized her, Lin Xiaowan thought to herself, \u2018How did 1 get recognized and remembered by such a playboy? How terrifying!\u2019\nCheng Ruitong did not answer the other party. Instead, she asked, \u201cWhat are you competing in?\u201d\nAnother young man scratched his head and laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. We\u2019re going to compete in archery. Sister Cheng, do you want to join us?\u201d\nSeeing the curiosity in Lin Xiaowan\u2019s wide eyes, Cheng Ruitong asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s the prize?\u201d\n\nThe young man pointed outside and said, \u201cA new car. There are only twenty models in the world. My brother just got them for me.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan was astonished when she heard this. She took another glance at the handsome young man.\nThe car was a limited-edition car. Even if he did not mention the brand or model, it was obvious that it was expensive. However, he casually used it as a prize. It was as though it was not a real car but a toy car.\nThe young man saw Lin Xiaowan sizing him up, and he responded with a smile. Then, he looked at Cheng Ruitong and asked hopefully, \u201cSister Cheng, do you want to join us? Let\u2019s race. It\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve played with you, Sister Cheng.\u201d\nCheng Ruitong came with Lin Xiaowan today. She was not sure if Lin Xiaowan would be interested in this so she politely declined the other party.\nLin Xiaowan did not play anymore. She sat and watched the others draw the bowstring and shoot the arrows with relish. She still remembered the first time she saw Cheng Ruitong; Cheng Ruitong stood expressionlessly, hitting bullseyes over and over again as though she had a grudge against the target.\nLin Xiaowan said, filled with praise, \u201cSister Cheng, I don\u2019t think they\u2019re as good as you.\u201d\nCheng Ruitong only smiled in response.\nAfter a while, Lin Xiaowan wondered if Huo Zheng knew these things. He had a good figure, with broad shoulders and long legs. If he stood there in his suit with a bow and arrow, he would definitely be 800 times more good-looking than this group of people. After a moment, she furtively studied the group of people and found that only the son of the real estate tycoon had a slightly better figure. Needless to say, the other party still could not compare to Huo Zheng.\nWhen Lin Xiaowan returned, she immediately \u2018reported\u2019 everything that happened while she was out. Then, she asked brightly, \u201cDo you know archery as well?\u201d\nNeedless to say, Huo Zheng knew archery. He said, \u201cNext time, let\u2019s go together.\u201d\nThen, he asked, \u201cWhy were you looking at a shirtless man?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan was speechless.\n\u201cWhat are you talking about? Who was shirtless? He wore a Hawaiian shirt with big flowers, and he just didn\u2019t button his buttons properly.\u201d\nHuo Zheng\u2019s expression remained indifferent, but his words were rather unreasonable. \u201cIn any case, you\u2019re not allowed to look.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan rolled her eyes. \u201cThe place isn\u2019t very big, and he was just standing there. It\u2019s hard not to look at him.\u201d\nThen, Lin Xiaowan poked him before she continued to say, \u201cPresident Huo, you\u2019re really unreasonable.\u201d\nPresident Huo, who was unreasonable, only hummed in acquiescence..\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

After the filming was completed, she was not in a hurry to go back and stayed for a few days. Coincidentally, she received a call from Lin Xiaowan, asking about fun things to do.\nGu Yuwu thought about it for a moment before she replied, \u201cShengjing is only that big. There aren\u2019t that many fun things to do. Do you want to go out and play? At the end of the month, there\u2019s a music festival at the sports stadium. Do you want to go?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan did not have much interest, and after Gu Yuwu asked a few questions, she truthfully confessed that she wanted to spend time with Huo Zheng.\nGu Yuwu said, \u201cI was going to invite you out today. It\u2019s fine if you bring President Huo along.\u201d\n\u201cWhere are you now?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not in Shengjing.\u201d\nWhen Lin Xiaowan heard this, she felt that it was not appropriate. After all, Huo Zheng was extremely busy with work. If he had to travel for a few days, he would have even more work. He was already tired, to begin with. In the end, she declined Gu Yuwu\u2019s invitation.\nEver since Lin Xiaowan created an account on Speaker, she would occasionally post her paintings. She recently discovered a new hobby, that was to paint the desserts in the shop into various personified figures. The style was not exquisite, but they garnered quite a fair bit of comments.\nGu Yuwu had also reposted her post before so her posts were quite popular.\nEver since Lin Xiaowan went through Gu Yuwu\u2019s past comments, they had been following each other and attracted many people\u2019s attention.\nGu Yuwu was in the entertainment industry after all. Initially, people assumed that Lin Xiaowan was an up-and-coming celebrity, but when they followed her account, they only saw paintings. Lin Xiaowan\u2019s account was also not verified; it was just an ordinary account. However, since Gu Yuwu was following her, they paid more attention to her. Perhaps, she would debut in the future.\nLin Xiaowan usually did pay attention to the notifications on Speaker. In the beginning, she would read the comments and even liked them. Later on, she gradually lost interest. On the other hand, she was slightly interested in the private messages received, especially the ones that asked about her painting or sent her pictures of artworks.\n\nToday, Lin Xiaowan received a question about art that she did not quite know the answer to. As such, she took a screenshot and sent it to Hong Minhua.\n[Hong Minhua: Little darling, when did you get a Speaker account? Why didn\u2019t you tell Grandma so Grandma can follow you?]\n[Lin Xiaowan: I just got it recently. The dessert shop has an account so I created one as well.]\nHong Minhua answered the question that Lin Xiaowan sent her before asking for Lin Xiaowan\u2019s username. Not long after, Lin Xiaowan gained another follower.\nHong Minghua looked at the paintings that Lin Xiaowan posted before she sent Lin Xiaowan a message.\n[Hong Minhua: When did you start this anthropomorphic series? You\u2019re quite creative\u2026]\nLin Xiaowan felt nervous, like a student whose homework was being checked by a teacher.\n[Lin Xiawaon: 1 just drew them when I was inspired\u2026]\nEver since the Bai family\u2019s birthday party, Lin Xiaowan always picked a time when there were fewer people to go to the dessert shop. Every time she went, her employees would tell her that people had been looking for her. When her employees told them that she was not around, they did not seem to believe her employees. As a result, she felt quite pressured and ended up hiding in the kitchen most of the time. She would take photos of the freshly baked desserts and upload them to the shop\u2019s Speaker account.\nThere was a communal phone with the shop\u2019s Speaker account, and it was kept behind the counter. Whoever was free would take a photo and upload it to the account.\nDuring that time, when Lin Xiaowan was free, she would draw the desserts in anthropomorphic states. Unexpectedly, Hong Minhua would praise them.\n[Hong Minhua: The colors are bold, which is good. However, some lines and details can\u2019t be improved. The strokes are a little immature, but you\u2019ve made great progress since the time you started.]\n[Hong Minhua: Are you interested in participating in a competition?]\nLin Xiaowan\u2019s eyes widened when she saw the message. She had only begun to take lessons not long ago. Moreover, she had learned it very casually as a hobby.\nWhen she had created her account on Speaker, she had listed art as her interest. For this reason, Speaker would usually recommend art-related posts to her. She had seen some artworks that won competitions, and she knew her artwork was far from being comparable to them.\n\n[Lin Xiaowan: No, no, no! I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea. How can I compete when the others are all professionals?]\n\u2018How can my half-baked artwork be worthy?\u2019\n[Hong Minhua: It\u2019s not a professional competition. It\u2019s just a casual competition for entertainment.]\n[Hong Minhua: Don\u2019t be nervous. In any case, the competition is not happening any time soon. When the time comes, 1\u201911 tell you more about it. You have your own style in this series, but your foundation is still weak. I\u2019ll give you more basic homework after this.]\nLin Xiaowan had never missed her art lessons with Hong Minhua. She would hand in her homework once a week. She did very well, and Hong Minhua also praised her for having a good sense of colors more than once.\nIn Hong Minima\u2019s opinion, if a good seedling like Lin Xiaowan could persevere, she would have quite a lot of achievements in the future.\nHowever, Lin Xiaowan did not take the praise to heart.\nHong Minhua had also seen Lin Xiaowan\u2019s attitude, and she knew that Lin Xiaowan was not passionate about art and was not ambitious. Lin Xiaowan was already very satisfied with being praised and had no desire to improve. For this reason, she was also very lax with Lin Xiaowan.\nHowever, the sudden appearance of Lin Xiaowan\u2019s anthropomorphic paintings made her think twice.\nHong Minhua continued to look through Lin Xiaowan\u2019s paintings before she left a comment on a post, pointing out a few of her shortcomings and areas that needed improvement. Of course, she also did not forget to praise Lin Xiaowan so Lin Xiaowan would not feel discouraged.\n[Hong Minhua: Now that I\u2019ve given you ideas on how to improve, do you think you can apply the changes to one of your paintings?]\n[Hong Minhua: You can just pick the one you like most and make the changes\u2026]\nLin Xiaowan looked at the comment in horror. Hong Minhua was a prominent figure after all. Moreover, the post the latter commented on was the latest one. There was no comment apart from the one by Hong Minhua.\n[Hong Minhua: Little darling, for this week\u2019s homework, draw ten sketches of people in motion.]\nLin Xiaowan could not pretend not to see her teacher\u2019s message so she could only reply bitterly.\n[Lin Xiaowan: Yes, Grandma.]\nShe even added a pouting emoji at the end..\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

Then, she sent the picture to Hong Minhua.\nHer anthropomorphic series was created on canvas with her brushes. She did not have much experience initially, and her details were crude.\nHong Minhua replied very quickly.\n[Hong Minhua: This is very good! Use this as a guide. However, the others have to be better than this one.]\n[Lin Xiaowan: I understand-]\nA few days later, Gu Yuwu finally returned. She had a live broadcast, and seeing that Lin Xiaowan was bored, she invited the latter to join her.\nLin Xiaowan was not very keen. \u201cI don\u2019t want to go. You have so many fans. There\u2019ll definitely be a lot of people coming to watch you. They might not even like me. It\u2019s best that I don\u2019t go.]\n\nHowever, after rejecting Gu Yuwu\u2019s invitation, Hong Minhua called and invited her to her house.\nLin Xiaowan had a hard time socializing with a group of elders so she also rejected Hong Minhua. However, Hong Minhua did not give up.\n[Hong Minhua: There are no outsiders. Your senior brother, Xiao Han, will be coming as well. He just won the grand prize. You can also discuss things with him.]\nLin Xiaowan was still unwilling.\n[Lin Xiaowan: All, we\u2019re not on the same level. What\u2019s there to discuss?]\nIn the end, Hong Minhua pretended to be angry, and Lin Xiaowan had no choice but to agree. After agreeing, she sighed heavily. If she had known this, she would have accepted Gu Yuwu\u2019s invitation. At least, when she was with Gu Yuwu, she could still fool around.\nHong Minhua called Lin Xiaowan on the day of the visit. It was nothing urgent. She only wanted Lin Xiaowan to bring some desserts from the shop over. She had not eaten the desserts for a few days and had a huge craving now.\nLin Xiaowan said tactfully, \u201cAlthough you look very young for your age, you should still consider your age. It\u2019s best to eat fewer of these things\u2026\u201d\nAlthough Lin Xiaowan also wanted to eat the desserts, she had to be more considerate of others.\nHong Minhua did not mind Lin Xiaowan\u2019s words. \u201cWhat kind of excuse is that? I\u2019m in excellent health. 1 can eat anything I want!\u201d\n\nHong Minhua also did not hesitate to use Xiao Han as an excuse as she said, \u201cYour senior brother was away from Shengjing previously so he has yet to try the desserts from your shop. You have to bring them here for him to try.\u201d\nAlthough Hong Minhua looked strong and healthy, Lin Xiaowan had heard from Hong Minhua\u2019s daughter, an elegant woman, previously that Hong Minhua\u2019s blood sugar level was very high. She looked helpless when she spoke about how she failed to control her mother\u2019s diet.\nPeople with high blood sugar levels should not eat too much food with high sugar content. Let alone desserts, even the consumption of fruits such as watermelons and peaches had to be controlled.\nLin Xiaowan was unaware of this before so whenever Hong Minhua came over in the past, she would happily let Hong Minhua try all the desserts she made. However, now that she knew better, she naturally could not turn a blind eye to it.\nShe said gently, \u201cGrandma Hong, why are you still so willful at your age? Why don\u2019t we do this? During our next lesson, 1\u201911 bring you some salty pepper cakes.\u201d\nHong Minhua retorted, \u201cWhat\u2019s so delicious about salty pepper cakes? By the way, what did your patissier make today? Previously, I saw there were blackcurrant cheesecakes and salted egg almond cream rolls. Can you bring them for me today?\u201d\nAt this moment, Lin Xiaowan was already in the car. She had already told the driver in advance to bring her to Hong Minhua\u2019s house. The dessert shop was not on the way at all.\n\u201cOf course not,\u201d Lin Xiaowan said before asking, \u201cWhy don\u2019t 1 personally bake you a sugar-free cake?\u201d\nSince the dessert shop hired patissiers, Lin Xiaowan had not made anything herself recently. She was not very sure if she would be any good so she added, \u201cHowever, 1 can\u2019t guarantee the taste.\u201d\nHong Minhua sighed and said, \u201cSince you\u2019ve already said so much, what else can I say? 1 continue to insist, then won\u2019t I really be willful?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan said sweetly, \u201cI was just talking nonsense earlier. Grandma Hong is not willful. Grandma Hong is the best!\u201d\n\u201cYour mouth is really sweet! Alright, come quickly! There\u2019s no one at home, and your senior brother hasn\u2019t arrived yet.

Hong Minhua indeed had the intention of letting Lin Xiaowan participate in the competition to gain experience. After all, Lin Xiaowan truly lacked experience. Her life was leisurely, and she did everything according to her preferences. If she was not interested in something, her expression, which made her look pitiful, would show it.\nXiao Han, on the contrary, had participated in countless competitions, big and small, and had won many awards.\nHong Minhua wanted someone to explain the matter to Lin Xiaowan and see if Lin Xiaowan would change her mind.\nLin Xiaowan and Xiao Han arrived at Hong Minhua\u2019s house almost right after each other. The duo had not seen each other for a long time.\nLin Xiaowan looked up and called out softly, \u201cHello, Senior Brother Xiao Han.\u201d\nXiao Han said with a smile, \u201cHello, Junior Sister.\u201d\n\nHong Minhua did not care much about formalities. She waved her hand and said, \u201cAlright, alright. There\u2019s no need to be so polite here. It\u2019s not the first time you meet each other.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan, who was much more familiar with Hong Minhua now, put her bag down and showed Hong Minhua something on her phone. She said, \u201cI recently found a patissier who makes pastry at home. His recipes look simple. Grandma Hong, have a look at what he\u2019s making today.\u201d\nHong Minhua put on her reading glasses. After all, she was already old. She needed her glasses to have a clearer look.\nMeanwhile, Xiao Han looked at his junior sister who was talking intimately to his teacher in a low voice and was a little lost in thought.\nLin Xiaowan seemed gentle and harmless. She always had a smile on her face. Her face seemed to always be glowing. When she spoke, it was slow and soft with a lilt at the end of her words. It made people pay attention to her.\nHong Minhua did not like savory snacks so she chose steamed white sugar cake.\nSeeing Xiao Han standing at the side silently, Lin Xiaowan called out twice to him to ask for his opinion, but he did not respond to her. In the end, she walked over and waved her hand in front of him as she called out again, \u201cSenior Brother Xiao Han?\u201d\nXiao Han returned to his senses and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan asked, \u201cWhy are you in a daze? I\u2019m going to make steamed white sugar cakes with Teacher. What do you think?\u201d\n\nXiao Han smiled, revealing his canine teeth, and said, \u201cI\u2019m fine with that. I\u2019ll help out. Although I don\u2019t know much about these things, it shouldn\u2019t be a problem for me to help.\u201d\nThey needed a lot of sugar to make steamed white sugar cake. Hong Minhua did not have enough at home, and she had already instructed someone to help her buy it. However, the other person had yet to arrive. Seeing there was time, she rose to her feet and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go. Follow me to the studio. Since we have some time now, let your senior brother help you?\u201d\n\u201cJunior Sister, how\u2019s your lesson going? If you have nothing to do, you should come to the studio,\u201d Xiao Han said.\nXiao Han would not stay in the studio for too long. The competition he had just participated in was very important, and the winning work was ready to be exhibited and auctioned off. There was a foreign art gallery that wanted to work with him, and he also wanted new experiences to broaden his horizon.\nHong Minhua chimed in, \u201cYour senior brother has a lot of experience with competitions. You should listen to what he has to say about them.\u201d\nThen, Hong Minhua sounded a little proud as she looked at her favorite student and continued to say, \u201cXiaowan doesn\u2019t have time to play around. After all, she\u2019s the boss of a shop now and has a lot of things to do\u2026\u201d\nLin Xiaowan felt very guilty when she heard these words. After all, she was not busy at all. Zhu Yingyue was the one who was really busy. She was just a silent partner. Recently, she did not even visit the shop much.\nMeanwhile, after hearing Hong Minhua\u2019s words, Xiao Han looked slightly surprised. He asked, \u201cJunior Sister is planning to participate in a competition?\u201d\nIt was only natural for Xiao Han to be surprised. After all, Lin Xiaowan had only started taking lessons recently. If Hong Minhua recommended someone to join a competition, it meant that the other person was very talented. He could not help but wonder how much Lin Xiaowan had improved for Hong Minhua to recommend Lin Xiaowan to participate in a competition..\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

The competition that Hong Minhua wanted her to participate in was not what he had imagined either. However, this was only natural since the two of them walked different paths.\nLin Xiaowan was different from Xiao Han. She was not doing this for recognition. She was only adding colors to her life by participating in competitions or winning prizes.\nHong Minhua instructed Lin Xiaowan to show her anthropomorphic dessert series to Xiao Han.\nThe flaws in her painting were obvious. There was not much problem with the details, but the backgrounds were a little bland. She was good at painting the subject, but the backgrounds were quite bland and not eye-catching enough.\nXiao Han commented, \u201cYour use of colors is quite creative.\u201d\nFor example, for the fruits on the desserts, Lin Xiaowan painted orange strawberries, pink pineapples, purple mangoes, and red avocados. She also mixed several colors together. Each character was vibrant and vivid.\nXiao Han liked her bold use of colors.\nAfter a moment, Xiao Han asked Hong Minhua, \u201cTeacher, are you thinking about letting Junior Sister participate in the Venus Hope Competition?\u201d\nThe scope of the Venus Hope Competition was very broad, and the rules were not rigid. It was different from professional competitions. Generally, the participants were amateurs. The competition focused on creativity. In short, if one felt that one was creative, one could participate. The winner would be selected based on their creativity.\nThe Venus Hope Competition was usually held around the new year. It was not even September now so there was still a long time to go.\n\u201cYou think she\u2019s suitable for that competition as well, don\u2019t you?\u201d Hong Minhua asked.\nXiao Han nodded in agreement. \u201cJunior Sister\u2019s style is indeed suitable for that competition.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan naturally had never heard of the competition before. She listened to the duo talk for a long time in confusion before she asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s the Venus Hope Competition?\u201d\n\nLin Xiaowan had no intention of participating in a competition. She did not understand them and was afraid it would be troublesome. Apart from that, she also felt that she was not skilled enough to participate in a competition. This feeling only grew stronger after she saw Xiao Han\u2019s award-winning work.\nXiao Han put his phone down and explained, \u201cThe Venus Hope Competition isn\u2019t a professional competition. It\u2019s very casual, and the rules are not rigid at all\u2026\u201d\nAfter that, he showed the works from the previous Venus Hope Competition to Lin Xiaowan on his phone.\n\u201cHave a look\u2026\u201d\nLin Xiaowan\u2019s attention was instantly drawn to the prize of the competition. She exclaimed, \u201cWow! The prize is really good!\u201d\nThe Venus Hope Competition was funded by a wealthy businessman so it did not lack money. The top three winners of the competition would receive a prize of 300,000 yuan, 200,000 yuan, and 100,000 yuan in cash respectively. Those who won various subsidiary titles would also be rewarded with 10,000 yuan in cash each.\nHong Minhua seized the opportunity and tried to tempt Lin Xiaowan. \u201cIt\u2019s not just that. Apart from the cash prize, the first-place winner will also receive a mystery gift.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan\u2019s eyes widened in shock.\n\u2018The prize is too good! Senior Brother Xiao Han said that it\u2019s not a professional competition, but the prize is so amazing! What are the prizes like then for professional competitions? Senior Brother Xiao Han participated in so many competitions. Doesn\u2019t this mean that he had won a lot of money?\u2019\nLin Xiaowan felt a little dizzy, thinking that painting could also be a source of income.\nIn fact, Lin Xiaowan had a slight misunderstanding. Not every competition was as generous as the Venus Hope Competition. Other competitions were more about recognition.\nAt this time, Xiao Han said, \u201cIt\u2019s called a mystery gift because the gift each year is different\u2026\u201d\nThe organizers of the Venus Hope Competition would create a poll half a year in advance to decide on the mystery gift. Many people, even those who had no intention of participating in the competition, would vote for the mystery gift to join in the fun.\nJust like that, Lin Xiaowan was successfully attracted.\nSeeing Lin Xiaowan\u2019s reaction, Hong Minhua knew there was an 80% chance that Lin Xiaowan would participate in the competition.\nOne of the voting channels for the mystery gift was on Speaker.\n\nLin Xiaowan looked at the five options that the organizers of the competition had given and marveled at how luxurious they were. When she swiped down to read the comments, she saw many bizarre recommendations as well.\nThe commenters\u2019 IP addresses would be displayed so Lin Xiaowan could see that the commenters were from all over the world. The comment section was really lively.\nLin Xiaowan was very excited. She decisively clicked on the \u2018Other\u2019 option on the poll before she commented, \u201cFly to the moon to watch a meteor shower!\u201d\nAt the same time, Gu Yuwu received a notification about a friend\u2019s activity on Speaker. She casually clicked it and saw Lin Xiaowan\u2019s latest activity on Speaker.\nGu Yuwu briefly read about the Venus Hope Competition. After understanding what it was about, she could not help but laugh and left a comment.\n[Gu Yuwu: The organizers are asking for suggestions for the prizes, not unrealistic dreams! Hahahahaha!]\nAfter that, she sent a message to Lin Xiaowan, asking the latter why she suddenly voted on the poll and if she intended to participate in the competition.\nMeanwhile, Lin Xiaowan, who was making steamed white sugar cakes with Hong Minhua and Xiao Han in the kitchen, did not see Gu Yuwu\u2019s message because her phone was not with her.\nHong Minhua watched as Lin Xiaowan added the sugar in a stingy manner. She said, displeased, \u201cYou\u2019re adding too little sugar. Add more for me.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan controlled the amount of sugar she used strictly. She said seriously, \u201cNo. You can\u2019t have too much sugar.\u201d\nThe old lady put her hands on her hips and said, \u201cI\u2019m just going to eat a little. The dosage doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan remained unmoved. She watched the video and proceeded to the next step as she said, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. I\u2019m not going to listen to you.\u201d\nXiao Han, who was helping by the side, could not help but laugh at the duo\u2019s interaction.\nMeanwhile, Hong Minhua could only give up. \u201cFine. After all, since you treat me as your grandma, 1 can only listen to you\u2026\u201d\nWhile they made the desserts, Hong Minhua called Lin Xiaowan using various nicknames such as Little Cutie and Darling. It could be seen that she was very fond of Lin Xiaowan.\nAfter a while, Hong Minhua recalled the blank backgrounds of Lin Xiaowan\u2019s painting so she said, \u201cYou should go out more often. Perhaps the scenery will inspire you. Don\u2019t always stay at home..\u201d\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

Some of them went to her homepage and saw the posts of artworks as well.\n[Fan #1:1 guess the two of them are friends. Moreover, 1 think the two of them are quite close. After all, Sister Gu rarely takes the initiative to interact with others.]\n[Fan #2: She\u2019s definitely not a celebrity. Is she an artist?]\n[Fan #3: Can I just say something about the anthropomorphic desserts she painted? They\u2019re really good. Her use of colors is also very interesting, and she has her own style in mixing colors.]\n[Fan #4:1 also think they\u2019re friends.

I really wish I could buy them!]\n[Fan #6:1 looked at her follower list. She has many influential and wealthy people following her. She must be a wealthy young lady as well\u2026]\n[Fan #7: Huh? Did all of you just find out that Lin Xiaowan is a good friend of Sister Gu? She\u2019s the owner of a dessert shop!]\nPreviously, Gu Yuwu had posted about the dessert shop. As such, many of her local fans visited the dessert shop.\n[Fan #7: Hahaha, 1 thought everyone knew about this! Lin Xiaowan is very beautiful, and she\u2019s kind and soft-spoken as well! The dessert shop is not far from my company so I\u2019ve visited before! ]\n[Fan #8: Am I on the 2G network? Why didn\u2019t I know about this at all?]\nSomeone posted a screenshot of Lin Xiaowan being listed as an administrator of the dessert shop\u2019s homepage. Her nickname was \u2018Little Boss\u2019.\n\nGu Yuwu was not a member of the page. After all, apart from posting the daily desserts, the other main function was to help customers make reservations. People like Gu Yuwu who was acquainted with the owners naturally did not have to make reservations. Moreover, she also had her own designated table there and could visit at any time.\n[Fan #9:1 know about the dessert shop, and 1 know Sister Gu has been there. However, 1 just found out that Sister Gu is a good friend of the owner\u2026]\n[Fan #10: Me too! 1 thought she only posted about the dessert shop because the desserts there are good. I\u2019ve been a few times so 1 can testify to that. The prices are very reasonable as well\u2026]\n[Fan #11: Oh, more information is coming out!]\n[Fan #12: People in Shengjing, raise your hands! I have a question. If I visit the dessert shop, will 1 meet Sister Gu by chance?]\n[Fan #13: The possibility is very low. Moreover, Sister Gu only sits on the second floor. You need to make reservations to sit on the second floor, and you need to be a member to make reservations. I\u2019ve inquired before, and there was a several-weekwait\u2026]\n[Fan #14: Are the desserts really delicious?

Not only that, but they used good ingredients as well. They sell Western desserts on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday; and local traditional desserts on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday. Don\u2019t go on Sunday. They\u2019re closed on Sunday.]\nThe topic gradually turned to desserts, but not everyone was interested in this. When a few people saw the dessert-related comments, they could not help but remind the others.\n[Fan #15: Be careful. Sister Gu doesn\u2019t like fans to dig into her private life.]\n[Fan #16: Don\u2019t worry. We\u2019re just curious. Moreover, we\u2019re discussing the dessert shop. It can\u2019t be considered digging into her private life! Anyway, I can\u2019t wait to visit the dessert shop!]\n[Fan #17: We\u2019ll wait for your news! Remember to report back after your visit! You have to give us an honest review! If the desserts are delicious, I\u2019ll visit the shop as well!]\nLin Xiaowan stayed at Hong Minhua\u2019s house until after dinner. Hong Minhua said that she would be having dinner alone; her family members were busy. For this reason, she decided to accompany Hong Minhua.\nWhen the cook served the food at 6 PM, there was a sudden commotion at the door. A moment later, a young man with chestnut-brown hair appeared. He was wearing a sports jersey and sneakers. He did not look surprised when he saw there were other people. He only said, \u201cGrandma, you have guests today.\u201d The young man had met Xiao Han before so he naturally greeted the latter. \u201cHello, Brother Xiao Han!\u201d\nAfter that, the young man waited for Hong Minhua to introduce him to Lin Xiaowan.\n\nLin Xiaowan did not expect another person to appear. Seeing how the other party was very casual and familiar with Hong Minhua, she guessed that the other party was Hong Minhua\u2019s grandson. After all, the other party was too young to be Hong Minhua\u2019s son.\nHong Minhua was surprised to see her eldest grandson. She asked, \u201cWhy did you suddenly come back at this time? Have you eaten? Do you want to join us?\u201d\nAfter that, Hong Minhua smiled and said, \u201cThis is Lin Xiaowan. 1 mentioned her to you before. Quick, say hello.\u201d Then, she looked at Lin Xiaowan and said, \u201cThis is my grandson, Zheng Xiangming.\u201d\n\u201cHello, Sister Xiaowan,\u201d Zheng Xiangming greeted Lin Xiaowan obediently.\nLin Xiaowan waved at him and smiled amiably. \u201cHello!\u201d\nZheng Xiangming had just returned from playing basketball, and he had cycled home. He was feeling unbearably hot at this moment. Even after drinking a large glass of ice water to quench his thirst, he was not in the mood to chat much. He quickly rushed upstairs to take a shower.\nLin Xiaowan waited until Zheng Xiangming went upstairs before she asked, \u201cGrandma Hong, how old is your grandson? He\u2019s really tall!\u201d\nZheng Xiangming was indeed very tall. He was tanned, and his physique was very good. He was the kind of boy who was really popular. When he played basketball, many girls would come to watch him.\n\u201cHe\u2019s in his third year of high school. His grades aren\u2019t too good, but they\u2019re not too bad as well. All in all, we don\u2019t have to worry much about him.\u201d\nHong Minhua had a son and a daughter-in-law. Her son-in-law was often away from the country due to work, and her daughter-in-law was usually alone. Zheng Xiangming grew up freely since his mother did not have any strict requirements for him. For that reason, everyone was satisfied that he grew up well and did not go astray.\nThe only thing Hong Minhua was not satisfied with was that Zheng Xiangming did not have many friends of the opposite gender.\nIt was only now that Lin Xiaowan found that Aunt Zheng, whom she had met at the dessert shop previously, was Hong Minhua\u2019s daughter-in-law, not her daughter. The mother-in-law and daughter-in-law had a very good relationship so they were not different mothers and daughters.\nLin Xiaowan exclaimed, \u201cHe\u2019s only in his third year of high school, but he\u2019s so tall?! He\u2019s at least 1.8 meters tall!\u201d\nXiao Han said, amused, \u201cThe time of a boy\u2019s growth is usually coming to an end in the third year of high school. His height isn\u2019t very rare\u2026\u201d\nLin Xiaowan nodded.\n\u2018That\u2019s right.. He\u2019s about to turn 18\u2026\u2019\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

He looked very young.\nWhen the servant saw the young master sitting at the table, the servant hurriedly brought over a bowl and chopsticks.\nEver since Zheng Xiangming came downstairs, his gaze would drift toward Lin Xiaowan from time to time, looking like he was hesitating to say something.\nSeeing this, Hong Minhua asked curiously, \u201cWhy do you keep looking at Xiaowan?\u201d\nZheng Xiangming was eating when he heard his grandmother\u2019s question. When he looked up and saw three pairs of eyes looking at him, his face flushed red immediately. He saw Lin Xiaowan\u2019s confused expression and was worried she would misunderstand him so he hurriedly explained, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. It\u2019s just that I\u2019ve seen Sister Xiaowan before. I\u2019ve been to her dessert shop. The girls in my school like the desserts there a lot. However, our classes usually end very late so there are very few chances for us to buy the desserts.\u201d\nZheng Xiangming was not very close to his female schoolmates. He did not like interacting with them very much. However, he had heard them talking about the dessert shop many times so it left an impression on him.\nThis was the second time Lin Xiaowan met a stranger who was filled with praise for the dessert shop. She was unsurprisingly delighted. At the same time, she also gained a new understanding of the word-of-mouth marketing strategy.\nLin Xiaowan understood the problem that Zheng Xiangming brought up as well. She asked, \u201cAre any of your schoolmates a member of the shop? You can make reservations for the desserts in advance.\u201d\nZheng Xiangming\u2019s face was still red. He nodded and continued to eat.\nHong Minhua knew it was not good to continue teasing a boy of Zheng Xiangming\u2019s age so she did not continue teasing him. However, she found his attitude toward Lin Xiaowan a little amusing. This was the first time he had seen him blushing because of a girl.\nHong Minhua really liked girls like Lin Xiaowan who was gentle and respectful. When they first met, she even wished Lin Xiaowan could become part of her family, wanting to matchmake Lin Xiaowan with her eldest grandson. Alas, her grandson was a little young, and Lin Xiaowan was also taken. Nonetheless, she could not help but wonder if her grandson had a crush on Lin Xiaowan.\n\nIn the end, Hong Minhua could not hold back and decided to test the water. She said casually, \u201cIn fact, Mingming, it\u2019s also appropriate for you to address Sister Xiaowan as Aunt Lin.\u201d\nZheng Xiangming looked up in confusion, and he also saw the confused expression on Lin Xiaowan\u2019s face. Although he did not know what his grandmother was up to, he still obediently called out, \u201cAunt Lin.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan was in a daze. Although Zheng Xiangming was in the third year of high school and was younger than her, she was only 24 or 25 years old this year. She was not at the age where a high school student needed to address her as \u2018Aunt\u2019.\nHong Minhua did not think too much about this. When she saw that Zheng Xiangming did not have any resistance toward the form of address, she also realized that she had thought too much. She used the communal chopsticks and picked up a piece of fish for Lin Xiaowan. She said affectionately, \u201cEat more. This fish doesn\u2019t have many bones.\u201d\n\u2018Oh,\u201d Lin Xiaowan replied in a daze. She still had not recovered from being called \u2018Aunt\u2019. If Zheng Xiangming was in third grade, she would not have reacted this way.\nWhen Lin Xiaowan came home, she finally saw Gu Yuwu\u2019s message. She told Gu Yuwu that she was not sure yet if she was going to participate in the competition and that she had just voted for fun.\nWhen Gu Yuwu heard that Hong Minhua asked Lin Xiaowan to go out more for inspiration, she asked, \u201cAre you interested in going to the countryside with me? We\u2019ll stay for a night at most.\u201d\nThe place Gu Yuwu mentioned was a very simple village. It was not in Shengjing, but in a remote area in the south.\n\u201cWhy are you going there?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan did not think Gu Yuwu would go to a southern village just for a holiday.\n\u201cI\u2019m going there for a photoshoot. I found a good subject.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan had never been to such a faraway place before. Thinking that she had nothing much to do, she agreed.\nAfter Huo Zheng learned about this, he silently checked his work schedule. After confirming that he did not have spare time to accompany her, he could only give up regretfully.\nBefore Lin Xiaowan left, he helped her pack her luggage.\n\nLin Xiaowan originally planned to pack only two sets of clothes, her toiletries, and her large water bottle. After all, Gu Yuwu said they would be staying a night at most. However, Huo Zheng disagreed. He packed all kinds of things for her like insect repellent, hydrating balm, powder, cold medicine, fever-relief patches, and medicine for indigestion. Not only that, but he also packed her a set of bedsheets and pillowcases.\nApart from that, Lin Xiaowan also packed her art supplies since she planned to look for inspiration during her trip. There were her drawing board, brushes, paints, and various tools.\nSeeing this, Huo Zheng sighed and said, \u201cBring an assistant with you.\u201d\nHe could not but worry about her.\nLin Xiaowan refused Huo Zheng\u2019s suggestion immediately.\nWhen she got into Gu Yuwu\u2019s car, she complained immediately, \u201cHuo Zheng is so annoying. I packed so many snacks, but he didn\u2019t allow me to bring them! He took all of them out!\u201d\nLin Xiaowan had spoken to Gu Yuwu previously so she knew that the village they were visiting was very simple. There was only one small shop in the village where the villagers bought necessities like rice, flour, grain, oil, daily necessities, and snacks. The nearest supermarket was dozens of miles away.\nThey set off early in the morning and only arrived at the village when the sun was setting. It was also at this time that Lin Xiaowan met the person Gu Yuwu mentioned previously.\nThe other party was a tall and thin man. He was casually dressed in a sweatshirt and a straw hat. His trousers were rolled up a few times, and he wore a pair of plastic sandals on his feet. He looked a little reserved with his hand clasped together. His face was weathered, and his hands and feet showed that he worked a lot.\nGu Yuwu was very enthusiastic and kept praising the man. Although the man was taciturn, he responded to all of Gu Yuwu\u2019s words. Apart from that, he also looked slightly proud when she praised him.\nIn fact, the man was a fashion designer who also walked the runway as a model. Whether it was the clothes he designed or the venues of his show, they were all very unique.\nLin Qing, the fashion designer whom Gu Yuwu liked, raised his hand and pointed to a large open space and said, \u201cPark your car there.\u201d\nTo get to his house, they needed to climb up many steps and cross a few small roads. These places were not accessible by car so they could only park the car and walk.\nAfter Lin Xiaowan got out of the car, she stood next to Gu Yuwu after she got her luggage and studied the village..\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

There was a stream flowing beside it, and the water was crystal clear. All in all, it was a beautiful place with mountains and rivers. If there was anything bad about it, it would be the level of poverty here.\nMost of the villagers were elderly people, women, and children. There were very few men. Most of the men had left the village to earn more money.\nPerhaps, the first step to improving the village would be to build a road first.\nLin Xiaowan was dizzy from the bumpy journey. She did not have car sickness, but she felt like vomiting from all the walking. She carried her art supplies and her luggage, which was relatively light.\nIn comparison, Gu Yuwu had more things to carry. After all, she was here to take photos of Lin Qing. She brought many props with her, and most of them were heavy.\nThe Gu family\u2019s driver had driven the women here. Seeing that they could not drive to their destination, he helped carry Gu Yuwu\u2019s luggage. He inhaled sharply as soon as he picked up Gu Yuwu\u2019s luggage. It was obvious that it was not light.\nLin Qing stopped the driver. He took the initiative to take the luggage as he said, \u201cLet me do it.\u201d\nLin Qing also helped Lin Xiaowan with her luggage.\nLin Xiaowan adjusted her clothes, which were slightly messy. When she saw Lin Qing carrying the two pieces of luggage, she hurriedly chased after him as she said, \u201cIt\u2019s fine. Mine isn\u2019t heavy. 1 carry it myself!\u201d\nLin Xiaowan felt embarrassed and did not want to trouble others.\nGu Yuwu also did not expect Lin Qing to be so proactive. She said, \u201cThat\u2019s right. It\u2019s too much for you to carry two alone.\u201d\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. They\u2019re not heavy,\u201d Lin Qing said nonchalantly. He did not let go as he continued to say, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to feel embarrassed. After all, you are helping me to take photos. I haven\u2019t even thanked you yet. Carrying these is nothing\u2026\u201d\nWhen they were approaching a few steps up ahead, Lin Qing easily picked up the luggage as he reminded, \u201cThe steps are narrow here. Be careful.\u201d\n\nLin Xiaowan did not expect such a thin man to be so strong. Her gaze inadvertently fell on the man\u2019s arms. Although he was thin, his arms and legs were muscular.\nThey walked for a long time before they finally arrived at the village. It was after dinnertime. They saw elderly people sitting on small stools and chatting. They were holding cattail leaf fans, which were rare nowadays, swatting mosquitoes away.\nThe summer heat had dissipated a lot now that it was September. The wind was refreshing after sunset; the cool weather was rather enjoyable.\nLin Xiaowan could tell that many of the old ladies were talking about them. This was not surprising since there were not many new faces in the village. Let alone old ladies who had nothing to do and loved to gossip, even ordinary people would discuss this matter.\nLin Xiaowan thought that she would be under immense pressure from all the scrutiny if she lived here. It was just like when she was in her hometown.\nLin Xiaowan looked at Lin Qing, who was silently walking in front of her. His face was expressionless, and beads of sweat could be seen on his forehead. She could not tell what he was thinking, and she wondered if he minded being the topic of discussion.\nIn any case, she did not like being the topic of discussion. Although they were strangers, it was difficult for her to maintain a good expression when she vaguely overheard their messy speculations and discussions.\nLin Qing\u2019s house was very far away. It was his ancestral home. There were chickens and ducks in the front yard, and a big dog was tied near the entrance. A small vegetable plot could be seen next to the house. Apart from a red pepper plant, it was impossible to tell what the other plants were despite their different leaves. There were also rows of flowers at the side.\nWhen the big dog saw people approaching, it barked and stood up.\nLin Qing stretched his leg out and gently pushed the door open before he said to the two women, \u201cIt\u2019s a little messy inside.\u201d\nAfter that, Lin Qing said something to the dog in a low voice, and the barking stopped. The dog only wagged its tail happily after that.\nThe dog did not look fierce so Lin Xiaowan tried to get closer to it. It did not bark, and it wagged its tail even harder than before.\nSeeing this, Lin Qing said, \u201cRhubarb has a good temper. You can play with her, but don\u2019t feed her anything. If you don\u2019t do it correctly, you risk getting bitten.\u201d\nThere was not even a clinic in the village. If someone was bitten, it would be very troublesome to seek treatment.\nAfter obtaining permission from Lin Qing, Lin Xiaowan patted the dog\u2019s head gingerly. However, she did not dare to get too close. After all, she had never owned a dog before. Although she was interested, she was still a little afraid due to her lack of experience.\nAt this moment, Gu Yuwu commented, \u201cYour courtyard is really well taken care of.\u201d\n\nLin Qing put down the things in his hands and asked, \u201cAre both of you okay with sharing a room?\u201d\nAlthough the house was not small, there were not many rooms. The first floor had a guest room and a living room, and the second floor was Lin Qing\u2019s room. The kitchen and the storeroom were on the left side of the first floor.\nGu Yuwu asked Lin Xiaowan, \u201cXiaowan, are you okay with sharing a room with me tonight?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan, who had crouched down to look at the chickens in the coop while she carried her art supplies on her back, said, \u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan was very curious about this place. She looked at the chickens and the ducks before she counted how many little red peppers had grown.\nAfter a while, Lin Qing came out with a pole and a bucket.\nUpon seeing this, Lin Xiaowan asked, \u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d\n\u201cFetch water,\u201d Lin Qing replied.\nThere was no running water in the village so Lin Qing had to fetch water for daily use such as cooking and washing.\nLin Xiaowan was curious again. She asked, \u201cCan I come with you?\u201d\nDespite being surprised, Lin Qing said, \u201cSure.\u201d\nThen, he asked hesitantly, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you put your things down first?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan had been carrying her art supplies since she had gotten out of the car, and Lin Qing did not know what she was carrying and wondered if she was tired.\nLin Xiaowan almost forgot that she was carrying her art supplies on her back. She quickly said, \u201cOh, wait for me! I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d\nAfter that, Lin Xiaowan jogged into the house and found the room. She put her things down and said to Gu Yuwu, \u201cI\u2019m going to fetch water with Lin Qing!\u201d\nGu Yuwu only shook her head and smiled when she saw Lin Xiaowan skipping away. After that, she lowered her head and sent a message.\n[Gu Yuwu: Your little darling has arrived safely. She\u2019s following my friend to fetch water. The signal here is not good. 1\u201911 tell her to call you when she returns.]\nEarlier, Huo Zheng received a message from Lin Xiaowan, telling him that she would be walking to the village. After that, he did not receive any other messages from her. He could not get through to her phone either. Worried about her, he had contacted Gu Yuwu..\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

There were quite a few old ladies sitting by the well at this time. They were in the midst of a discussion when they saw Lin Xiaowan and Lin Qing. They fell silent immediately and looked at the duo with curious gazes. If this happened in the past, Lin Xiaowan would have felt extremely nervous being stared at like this. However, now, she only looked up and met their eyes silently.\nThe old ladies probably did not expect Lin Xiaowan to boldly meet their eyes so they averted their eyes one after another and looked around before their eyes fell on Lin Xing, who was drawing water with a hemp rope tied to the bucket. They did not say anything, but they exchanged meaningful looks with each other.\nFor some reason, Lin Xiaowan felt that their gazes were not very friendly. Since they had arrived, she had a feeling that the majority of the villagers did not seem to like Lin Qing. Moreover, she had overheard a few criticisms as well. She felt that his current state was like when she was living in her hometown. She was also extremely unpopular there. When the old ladies there saw her, they would criticize her behind her back, not daring to question her directly. Their eyes were like searchlights, staring at her from afar.\nHowever, Lin Qing did not seem to care about other people. He remained expressionless and turned a blind eye to those old ladies. As he fetched water, he said to Lin Xiaowan, \u201cThe well water here is very cold. If the weather is hot tomorrow, we can soak the watermelon in cold water before eating it.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan no longer paid attention to the old ladies. She crouched down and looked at the bucket before she asked, \u201cCan 1 drink this water directly?\u201d \u2018Mineral water should be like this, right?\u2019\nLin Qing shook his head and said in a slightly regretful tone, \u201cIt\u2019s better not to drink it directly now. It would have been fine if it was ten or twenty years ago.\u201d\nNot only was the water different from before, but people\u2019s stomachs were also weaker now. It would probably make one sick if one drank the water directly now.\nLin Qing filled two buckets of water before weighing them and lifting them. He squatted down and leaned sideways, easily carrying the pole on his shoulders. The two buckets only swayed slightly, and no water spilled from them.\n\u201cLet\u2019s go back,\u201d Lin Qing said.\n\u201cAll, okay!\u201d\nLin Xiaowan skipped as they returned, looking at the roadside flowers and plucking them. After a while, she seemed to think of something and asked, \u201cOur surnames are Lin. Did your Lin family originate from Shuangmu?\u201d\nLin Qing smiled. \u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat a coincidence!\u201d Lin Xiaowan said, \u201cPerhaps, we share the same ancestors from 500 years ago!\u201d\nThinking that she had not seen any fruit shops since she arrived, Lin Xiaowan asked again, \u201cDoes the small shop in the village sell fruits?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan loved eating fruits, especially in the summer. When she was bored, she would look for fruits to eat.\nLin Qing carried two buckets filled with water, but his steps were light and agile. The distance between each of his steps was also large, and Lin Xiaowan had to walk quickly to catch up with him. Despite all of this, he was not out of breath at all when he replied, \u201cNo. I planted the watermelons myself.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan carefully recalled the layout of Lin Qing\u2019s courtyard before she said, \u201cI didn\u2019t see any watermelons earlier\u2026\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re not in the yard. I have a fruit and vegetable garden at the back as well.\nI usually grow my own vegetables and fruits to eat. If you\u2019re interested, I\u2019ll bring you to have a look.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan was very interested. \u201cOkay!\u201d\nWhen the duo returned, Gu Yuwu was holding a camera and taking photos. When she saw Lin Qing carrying water into the house, she quickly pressed the shutter. As he walked in earlier, there was a ray of light that shone over.\nWhen Gu Yuwu saw Lin Xiaowan following Lin Qing to the kitchen, she said, \u201cHuo Zheng couldn\u2019t get in touch with you so he contacted me. If you\u2019re free now, hurry up and call him back.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan did not have pockets today. After getting out of the car, she had put her phone away in Gu Yuwu\u2019s bag. After Gu Yuwu\u2019s reminder, she turned back and asked for her phone from Gu Yuwu.\n\u201cIt\u2019s in the house. However, the signal here isn\u2019t very good. You might not be able to hear clearly. In any case, give it a try.\u201d\nWhen Lin Xiaowan found her phone, she saw that there was only one pitiful bar that was lit. She saw two missed calls and a few messages from Huo Zheng.\n[Huo Zheng: Watch your steps when you walk. If your things are too heavy, walk slowly. Don\u2019t trip.]\n[Huo Zheng: Give me a call when you arrive, okay?]\n\nAfter another 15 minutes, seeing that there was no reply, Huo Zeng sent another message again.\n[Huo Zheng: Have you arrived?]\nAfter another 15 minutes, he sent a message again.\n[Huo Zheng: You haven\u2019t arrived?]\nPerhaps he had already contacted Gu Yuwu, there was no more message after that.\nLin Xiaowan replied with a cute cat-poking-its-head-out emoji first.\n[Lin Xiaowan: I\u2019ve arrived.]\nHowever, the message and the emoji were not sent immediately, and the buffering circle at the end of the messages did not disappear for a long time. After a long time, a red exclamation mark appeared at the end of the emoji, indicating that she had failed to send the emoji. Only the message was sent out. Just as Gu Yuwu had said earlier, the signal here was bad.\nHowever, it did not matter that the cat emoji was not sent. After Huo Zheng finally received a reply, he quickly called his girlfriend, whom he was worried about.\nWhen the familiar string of numbers appeared on her phone, Lin Xiaowan immediately answered the call.\n\u201cHello,\u201d she said before frowning. She could only hear Huo Zheng\u2019s voice intermittently, and there was a buzzing and crackling noise.\nThis was the first time she had encountered such a situation. She called out a few times, \u201cHello? Can you hear me? The signal here isn\u2019t good so I can\u2019t hear you.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan stood up and raised her phone before she paced around looking for signal. However, it was still the same. She still could not hear him clearly and could only ask again, \u201cHello? Can you hear me? The signal is too bad. I\u2019ll hang up first and send you a message.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan sighed. \u2018I wonder if I can even send messages\u2026\u2019\nIt took a few tries before she successfully sent him a message, telling him that the signal was very bad.\nAt the same time, she also received a message from Huo Zheng. He could not hear her earlier so he could only send her a message, asking about what she had said earlier..\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

At this moment, she really felt as though she had returned to the 2G era with monthly traffic of 30 million.\nWhen Huo Zheng saw the message from her, he felt a little helpless for a moment. He also did not expect the signal to be so bad. To think there was a place with such poor signal.\nLin Xiaowan exchanged a few messages with Huo Zheng with great difficulty for a while before she finally lost her patience. Then, she sent a final message, which was fortunately successfully sent.\n[Lin Xiaowan: 1 don\u2019t want to talk anymore! I\u2019m going to look around!]\nAfter that, Lin Xiaowan put her phone away and left.\nAt the same time, Huo Zheng, who was in his office in Shengjing, called his phone through the internal phone. After giving Lin Xiaowan\u2019s location to Assistant Song, he said, \u201cCheck this place out, and write me a simple report.\u201d\nAssistant Song was perplexed when he received such a random task. When he recovered he asked, \u201cWhen do you want the report?\u201d\n\u201cToday,\u201d Huo Zheng replied. He looked at the time before he added, \u201cBefore you get off work.\u201d\nAssistant Song looked at his inhumane boss in disbelief before he left the office.\n\u2018What does he mean by before 1 get off work? If it weren\u2019t for the fact that 1 have some unfinished work, 1 would have already gotten off work!\u2019\nAssistant Song gritted his teeth and began to look through the information.\nFor dinner, they picked fresh vegetables from Lin Qing\u2019s vegetable garden. The fruit and vegetable garden was large, and Lin Qing planted a variety of things. Although there were not many of them, there was a wide variety. The fruits and vegetables grew well, but they were not very big in size. In fact, they were a little small\n\nWhen Lin Xiaowan saw Lin Qing\u2019s watermelons, she found that the watermelons Lin Qing mentioned when they were by the well earlier were the size of a grapefruit. Apart from that, the rinds of the watermelon were very thin. Nonetheless, they were extremely sweet, juicy, and delicious.\nLin Xiaowan looked at the colorful fruits and vegetables in the garden when she suddenly thought of something.\n\u2018Perhaps I can draw anthropomorphic fruits and vegetables? Teacher Hong said that my background was monotonous and boring. Perhaps, I can draw inspiration from the scenery here as well\u2026\u2019\nLin Xiaowan was not in a hurry to take action. She took a few photos from different angles and thought about the content and scope of her painting. She had forgotten to look at the specifications of the Venus Hope Competition, but she wanted to make her painting bigger.\nAt night, Lin Qing filled a thermos bottle with hot water.\nThe last time Lin Xiaowan had seen this kind of gaudy and old-fashioned thermos with flowery patterns was at her grandmother\u2019s house. Her grandmother did not have a water dispenser and could only use a thermos. However, at that time, her grandmother did not even let her use the thermos, and she could only drink cold water all year round.\nWhile Lin Xiaowan was showering, she suddenly realized that she did not bring her pajamas. When she came out of the shower, she opened her luggage, planning to find a random piece of clothing to wear. However, as soon as she opened her luggage, she saw a new set of pajamas. It was Huo Zheng who had packed it for her.\nLin Xiaowan tried to send him a few cute messages to express her gratitude, but in the end, she only managed to send a message that only contained a kissing emoji. It did not take long before she gave up. It was too taxing to send messages.\nWhen it was time to sleep, Lin Xiaowan marveled at Huo Zheng\u2019s foresight again. Fortunately, he had helped her pack mosquito repellent spray and bracelets. There were too many mosquitoes in the mountain village.\nGu Yuwu put on the mosquito-repellent bracelets on her wrists and ankles before she sprayed the mosquito repellent around the bed. At the same time, she said, \u201c1 have to say, Huo Zheng\u2019s image in my heart has never been so high before\u2026\u201d\n\u2018That Qin Yanchuan, why didn\u2019t he check my luggage?\u2019\nDue to the poor signal, Lin Xiaowan had no way to express her love and gratitude to her boyfriend. She felt like it was inappropriate to complain about it to Gu Yuwu since it would seem like she was showing off.\nIn the end, she drafted a message on her phone, typing out everything she wanted to say so she could show it to Huo Zheng when she returned.\nThe next day, Gu Yuwu got to work quickly. After all, the main purpose of her visit was to do a photoshoot.\nWhen Lin Xiaowan saw the various \u2018fashionable\u2019 clothing that Lin Qing designed, her eyes almost popped out of their sockets. His clothes were completely different from what she was used to. They were made from things like plastic bags, plastic bottles, paper wrappings, and fertilizer sacks with the word \u2018carbamide\u2019 on them. All in all, Lin Qing used many waste materials to design his clothes. However, it had to be said that his design was very good.\n\nAfter that, Lin Xiaowan had another experience that made her admire Lin Qing even more.\nMost of the clothes that Lin Qing designed were dresses. Due to the material he used, they looked very sexy. However, when he put them on, he did not feel embarrassed at all, and he looked very graceful. It was like he was not restricted by gender at all.\nLin Xiaowan watched in admiration as Lin Qing strutted around the clothes he designed. He placed his hands on his hips, and he held his head high. When he walked, it felt like his entire person was glowing. He looked confident and proud.\nWhen Lin Qing saw Lin Xiaowan staring at him with her mouth agape and eyes filled with shock and disbelief, he laughed and asked, \u201cDo you think I\u2019m strange?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan shook her head frantically and said, \u201cNo, no, no! In fact, I think you\u2019re amazing!\u201d\nAt the same time, Lin Xiaowan also understood why the villagers disliked Lin Qing.\nIn this remote and backward mountain village, Lin Qing was undoubtedly strange in the eyes of the elderly people. After all, he did not fit the image of a \u2018man\u2019 that they knew. After all, he wore dresses.\nLin Xiaowan felt as though her eyes had been opened. She was truly glad she followed Gu Yuwu here.\nGu Yuwu\u2019s shutter did not stop moving, and she kept praising Lin Qing. She did not need to deliberately guide him since he was very photogenic. His expressions, his poses, and his unique clothes were very good.\n\u201cDo you really have no intention of making a debut? There aren\u2019t many people like you in the entertainment industry. You\u2019re really very unique.\u201d\nGu Yuwu was attracted by Lin Qing\u2019s uniqueness the moment she saw him. In his video, he spoke very little, and his expression was always the same.\nMost of the comments under his videos were not very pleasant. However, whether it was encouraging comments or hate comments, he did not respond to them at all. He just posted videos of him or other people wearing the clothes he designed.\nWhen Gu Yuwu contacted him, she was not very confident that he would agree to her request. It took a long time before she received a reply from him. She had also asked back then if he had any interest in joining the entertainment industry, and he refused her.\nAt this time, just like before, Lin Qing still refused her. He shook his head and said, \u201cThe entertainment industry isn\u2019t for someone like me. It doesn\u2019t suit me.\u201d\nSuddenly, Lin Xiaowan could no longer hold back her curiosity so she asked, \u201cWhy did you choose to live here?\u201d\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

Every move one made would be quickly known by everyone. There was no privacy here, it was difficult to make friends here, and it was difficult to get recognized here.\nLin Qing\u2019s reply was very simple. He said, \u201cThe expenses here are low, and I don\u2019t need to pay rent.\u201d\n\u201cBut\u2026 1 feel like the villagers here are a little strange\u2026\u201d Lin Xiaowan said vaguely. She did not directly say that she felt that the villagers did not like him.\nNonetheless, Lin Qing understood her meaning immediately. His expression was relaxed as he replied, \u201cPerhaps no one likes me here, but so what? I don\u2019t know them so it doesn\u2019t matter if they like me or not. Moreover, no matter how much they talk about me behind my back, they don\u2019t dare to do anything in front of me. Since they don\u2019t do or say anything in front of me, I\u2019ll just pretend like 1 don\u2019t know anything\u2026 I\u2019m doing what I want to do. I\u2019m not breaking the law or committing a crime. Why should I care about what others think of me?\u201d\nThen, a rare shy and embarrassed smile appeared on Lin Qing\u2019s face as he continued to say, \u201cMoreover\u2026 Didn\u2019t I meet the two of you who admire me?\u201d\nLin Qing was not like this in the beginning. His original intention of moving to this place was to escape the strange gazes that were cast on him. However, after moving to this remote place, he was even more depressed. The people here were even more excessive. They had nothing to do since they were old. They would sit together every day to gossip.\nLin Qing considered leaving this place for a long time before he decided against it. Where could he go if he left? He was not very cultured, and he did not want to give up the only thing he loved. Fortunately, as time passed, he no longer cared about what people thought of him.\nGu Yuwu and Lin Xiaowan originally planned to leave in the afternoon. However, the weather forecast was not very good at night. It was already dangerous to drive at night, but coupled with bad weather, it would be even more dangerous. For this reason, they decided to stay another night.\nThere was a huge cement rooftop balcony above the second floor. It was usually used to dry grains, but Lin Qing did not use it for this purpose. Instead, he built a small shed on it and left it at that.\nThat night, the three of them had a barbecue on the rooftop balcony.\n\nThe chicken and duck meat were from the chickens and ducks Lin Qing raised, and the fish were the ones he fished himself. Just like before, the vegetables and fruits were from his garden.\nHowever, Lin Qing did not use many seasonings. He usually ate light food and ate simple meals. So there was only oil, salt, and soy sauce in his house.\nFrom the rooftop, they could see the houses around them clearly. They could also see the people walking on the street or cooking in their yards.\nDespite the poor signal, Lin Xiaowan liked it here. She sat on the rooftop and drew a picture of Lin Qing\u2019s house.\nLin Qing liked it very much and asked if he could give it to him.\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Lin Xiaowan replied. An embarrassed expression could be seen on her face as she continued to say, \u201cHowever, 1 only drew this casually. Let me draw another one for you later\u2026\u201d\n\u201cNo need. I think this one is very good,\u201d Lin Qing said.\nGu Yuwu took a sip of watermelon juice before she said, \u201cAfter 1 return, I\u2019ll make you a photo album. I\u2019ll also pick the photo you like the most so 1 can print it and frame it for you. You can hang it in your house.\u201d\nGu Yuwu planned to send these things to Lin Qing by express delivery, but it was inconvenient for him to receive packages since there was no courier service in the village. He would have to go to the nearest town to pick up his packages. After thinking about it, she said, \u201cWhen the time comes, 1\u201911 arrange for someone to send the things here so you don\u2019t have to go and get them yourself.\u201d\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Lin Qing said gratefully.\nLater in the night, it began to rain, and water began to leak into the second floor.\nLin Qing ran up and down to find containers to collect the water.\nLin Xiaowan was usually a light sleeper when sleeping in unfamiliar places. The house was not soundproof so even the slightest movement would wake her up. After waking up, she decided to go out and have a look. As soon as she left the room, she saw Lin Qing. She looked at her watch and saw that it was 2 AM. She could not help but ask softly, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\n\n\u201cDid I wake you up?\u201d Lin Qing asked in a low voice, \u201cThere\u2019s a leak upstairs so I\u2019m cleaning up.\u201d\n\u201cNo. I\u2019m just a light sleeper,\u201d Lin Xiaowan said as she shook her head. Looking at the things in his hands, she asked, \u201cDo you need help?\u201d\nLin Qing was about to refuse when he thought about the situation upstairs. Hence, he said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, then I\u2019ll appreciate it\u2026\u201d\nNormally, if it rained, Lin Qing would move and sleep in the other room. However, Gu Yuwu and Lin Xiaowan were occupying the room today. Initially, he thought that it would be fine since the rain was not heavy. Who knew that in the middle of the night, not only did the water leak in the room, but it also leaked onto his bed?\nLin Xiaowan followed Lin Qing to the second floor.\nIt was very spacious and simple. Things were piled up everywhere just like a waste recycling station. However, to Lin Qing, these were not waste materials, these were materials for his designs. They were like treasures to him. Perhaps it was due to the leakage, the things were covered in transparent plastic sheets.\nSeeing Lin Xiaowan looking around, Lin Qing kicked the thing next to his foot away before he said awkwardly, \u201cThe second floor is a little messy.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan did not mind it at all. She shook her head and said, \u201cNo, it\u2019s fine. My old room was even messier than this. There was no place to walk around at all.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan\u2019s old room in her grandmother\u2019s house was very small. It was already filled to the brim with just a bed, a wooden desk, and a bulky old-fashioned wardrobe. The wardrobe was filled with her grandmother\u2019s things so her clothes would be piled up on her bed during the day and on the chair at night.\n\u201cI\u2019ll have to trouble you to help me move the bed.\u201d\nThe water leakage on the side of the bed was particularly serious. The wall was very wet, and the bed was also very wet.\nLin Qing placed a small plastic container to collect water. Based on the sound, the water was dripping very quickly, which also meant that the leakage was very bad.\nThe two of them stood facing each other with Lin Qing\u2019s bed, which had a metal frame, between them.\nLin Qing was afraid that Lin Xiaowan would hurt herself so he said, \u201cLook at the round knobs. Just grab them. The bed isn\u2019t heavy. Let me turn it around first before we move it to the side..\u201d\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

I\u2019ll clean up the rest myself. You should go to sleep.\u201d\nIn fact, Lin Xiaowan still wanted to chat with him a little more. People like Lin Qing were very likable. However, she really did not know how to tell him she wanted to talk some more; she was also afraid of disturbing him. In the end, she said good night to him before she went downstairs.\nShe could not fall asleep after she returned to her bed. She wanted to send a message but remembered the poor signal. As such, she began to draft out a message containing everything she wanted to say and saved it, planning to show it to Huo Zheng when she returned.\nThe next day.\nGu Yuwu and Lin Xiaowan set off early in the morning. When they left, Lin Qing was mixing cement in the yard to fix the leak. It seemed like he was really all-rounded.\nLin Qing helped them carry their luggage just like when they came and walked them to the car.\n\u201cBe careful on the road,\u201d Lin Qing said as he waved his hand. He did not ask them to visit again nor did he show any signs of reluctance. He just smiled and waved at them.\nThey had left very early; it was only a little past 6 AM. Most of the villagers were still sleeping soundly. Only a few people could be seen strolling around. Only the sounds of birds chirping and roosters crowing could be heard. However, it was not noisy at all. Instead, it seemed to make the place even quieter.\nLin Xiaowan woke up after midnight, and she tossed and turned for a long time before falling asleep after she returned to her bed. She did not get to sleep for long before Gu Yuwu woke her up. She leaned against the car window, still sleepy, as she watched Lin Qing\u2019s figure disappear from sight. For some reason, she felt that Lin Qing looked a little lonely.\nLin Xiaowan yawned and closed her eyes, but when she woke up, they were already on the highway.\nSeeing that she was awake, Gu Yuwu, who was working on her laptop, asked, \u201cAre you hungry?\u201d\nPreviously, Gu Yuwu wanted to do a live broadcast in Lin Qing\u2019s place, but she discovered that the signal was too poor. There was no way she could do a live broadcast there so she could only give up. Fortunately, she shot many videos that she could use. She had obtained Lin Qing\u2019s permission beforehand to use them.\n\nLin Xiaowan shook her head in response to Gu Yuwu\u2019s question before she wrapped herself in the blanket and looked at her phone. She did not know where she was now, but the signal had returned. She replied to Huo Zheng\u2019s message first before she lay down and browsed the Internet.\nUpon seeing this, Gu Yuwu said, \u201cDon\u2019t lie down and look at your phone.\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Lin Xiaowan replied. She twisted a few times, looking like a baby silkworm before she sat up.\nShe looked at the photos she had taken previously, and many ideas for her painting raced through her mind. This time, it was not just characters, but also the scenery she had seen in the village. She recalled what Hong Minima said about going out more often to find inspiration and thought that this was what Hong Minima meant.\nGu Yuwu worked on editing the videos she had taken for a few days, in the end, the video she edited was more than 30 minutes long. Before posting it, she sent it to Lin Xiaowan first.\n[Gu Yuwu: There\u2019s a shot of you in the video, but I\u2019ve already censored it for you. See if it\u2019s okay.]\nAfter sending the video, she called Lin Xiaowan.\nLin Xiaowan had been bursting with inspiration after she returned from the village. She had been holed up in the studio since her return. When she received Gu Yuwu\u2019s call, she was still in a daze.\n\u201cSo you were taking videos as well? 1 thought you were only taking pictures\u2026\u201d\nLin Xiaowan watched the video from the beginning until the end. She did not appear much in the video. Gu Yuwu had edited the video carefully. Most of the time she only appeared in the shot because Lin Qing was in the shot, but Gu Yuwu had covered her face with an emoji,\n[Lin Xiaowan: You edited the video very well!]\nThere were scenes of Lin Qing picking fruits and vegetables, him showing off his clothes, chatting, eating barbecue together on the rooftop, and so on. There were also scenes of Lin Qing catching the chickens and Lin Xiaowan drawing. At the end of the video, there were also two edited photos of Lin Qing.\nAfter posting the video, Gu Yuwu also tagged Lin Qing in the comment section so he could watch the video. For this reason, Lin Qing\u2019s number of fans increased along with his popularity. One of the main reasons for this was his unique temperament.\nWhen some people saw a person whose face had been censored in the video, they were naturally curious.\n[Fan #1: Who\u2019s that? Is she an assistant?]\nWhen Gu Yuwu was working on set, she had a young female assistant who had just graduated. She had appeared in a few of Gu Yuwu\u2019s videos, but her face was not hidden.\n[Fan #2: No. Sister Gu wouldn\u2019t have censored her face. It\u2019s probably a friend or a passerby\u2026]\n\n[Fan #3: That person\u2019s face is censored with the word \u2018villager\u2019. However, is she really a villager?]\n[Fan #4: What kind of villager would wear something from A Brand\u2019s summer collection? Her voice is very pleasing to the ears. It\u2019s soft and sweet.]\n[Fan #5:1 can tell that girl likes Lin Qing a lot! She stuck to him so closely!\nHahaha! She seemed very eager to help as well, but it seemed like she wasn\u2019t of much help in the end! Hahaha!]\n[Fan #6: Yes! She looked really eager and happy to help! Even if she didn\u2019t know anything, she still wanted to help! It\u2019d make you feel guilty if you refused to let her help you!]\nWhen Lin Xiaowan saw the comments, she was shocked. She quickly took a screenshot and sent it to Gu Yuwu.\n[Lin Xiaowan: I was clearly very serious about helping Ling Qin!]\n[LinXiaowan: Lin Qing!]\nBecause she was too quick, she even spelled Lin Qing\u2019s name wrongly, making Gu Yuwu laugh.\nLin Xiaowan was the kind of person who could not bear to see others busy themselves with matters related to her. She felt guilty enjoying the fruits of other people\u2019s labor. It made her feel uneasy so she felt like she had to help out. She did not expect that her help would be seen as a hindrance.\nLin Xiaowan sent a crying emoji to Gu Yuwu.\n[Gu Yuwu: Yes, yes, you were very serious. *laughing emoji*]\n[Lin Xiaowan: You\u2019re just being perfunctory. *crying emoji*]\n[Lin Xiaowan: It\u2019s fine, I understand. Don\u2019t worry about me. 1\u201911 be fine after crying for two hours!]\nGu Yuwu took a screenshot of their chat and even posted it online. She naturally hid Lin Xiaowan\u2019s name and profile picture. She uploaded the screenshot along with the caption: Don\u2019t talk about the little darling like that. She\u2019s clearly helping him seriously! Hahaha!\nMany people laughed when they saw this. Some even wondered if Lin Xiaowan would cry even more when she saw this post. At the same time, people also became even more curious about Lin Xiaowan\u2019s identity.\nGu Yuwu responded to a comment asking about Lin Xiaowan\u2019s reaction to the post and asked if the latter would cry.\n[Gu Yuwu: Probably not. She doesn\u2019t really use Speaker that much.]\n[Fan #1: I\u2019m going to make a bold and blind guess that she\u2019s the artist that Sister Gu posted about previously. There was a scene in the video that showed her drawing. Among the people Sister Gu interacts with, Xiaowan is the only one who draws..]\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

In the end, this matter passed, replaced by discussions about Lin Qing.\nJust as Gu Yuwu had said, Lin Xiaowan did not check her Speaker account. After complaining to Gu Yuwu, she threw this matter to the back of her mind. After returning from the village, she looked at the information regarding the Venus Hope Competition. After confirming the basic requirements, she quickly made a sketch.\nWhen she was done, she quickly asked for Hong Minhua\u2019s opinion.\nLin Xiaowan planned to draw Lin Qing wearing his own design while the background would be his fruit and vegetable garden. She planned to turn the vegetables and fruits into anthropomorphic characters as well.\nHong Minhua did not find any problem with her idea and even gave her a few pointers.\nLin Xiaowan noted Hong Minhua\u2019s pointers down seriously.\nHong Minhua suddenly thought of something and asked, \u201cThere\u2019s an art exhibition in two days. 1\u201911 be busy, but you can go with your Senior Brother Xiao Han to broaden your horizons.\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Lin Xiaowan replied with a nod.\nThe venue for the art exhibition was a remote exhibition hall. A stone path led to the small entrance, and if one did not pay attention, one would miss it.\nAfter parking the car in the underground parking lot, Xiao Han opened the door for Lin Xiaowan.\nThe entrance of the art gallery looked deserted, but when they entered, it was a completely different world.\nThe interior was stylish, and the ceiling was very high.\nPeople gathered in groups of twos and threes, whispering to each other.\n\nThe atmosphere was quiet and elegant.\nOne of the people from the organizing committee with white hair was very enthusiastic after he was introduced to Lin Xiaowan. He asked, \u201cWhen did Professor Hong accept a new student? Why haven\u2019t I heard of it?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan hurriedly explained, \u201cI\u2019m not a professional. It\u2019s just that my boyfriend has a good relationship with Professor Hong so she\u2019s kind enough to teach me. My skills are only average.\u201d\nThe other party did not seem to care about this. He laughed heartily and said, \u201cThere\u2019s no need to be so modest. Professor Hong doesn\u2019t have many students so I\u2019m just asking out of curiosity.\u201d\nAfter that, the other party added, \u201cAlright, let your senior brother bring you around and introduce you to the others. Your senior brother is a newcomer whom everyone is optimistic about!\u201d\nThe paintings that were being exhibited were also for sale.\nXiao Han brought Lin Xiaowan around as they discussed the different techniques of each painting and the meaning behind them.\nLin Xiaowan nodded as she listened, looking as though she only half-understood what he said. Her expression was a mixture of awe and confusion. If she had come on her own, she would not have learned so many things.\nHowever, it did not matter if she understood the meaning the artists were trying to convey or not. She found all of the paintings beautiful.\nA few of Xiao Han\u2019s paintings were also part of the exhibition. The one they were looking at had a strong sense of conflict. The background seemed to be of a war-torn place, but the subject was a little girl with pigtails sleeping soundly on the lap of a woman, who wore a slight smile and calm expression on her face.\nLin Xiaowan did not understand the painting much. She only felt that it was very impressive.\nXiao Han said, \u201cThe most important thing in painting is emotion. If you draw without emotions, even if the final product is beautiful, you\u2019ll find that it can\u2019t touch people\u2019s souls.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not trying to brag, but this is the painting that won me an award previously. 1 like it very much. Every time I see it, I feel like I\u2019m the best artist in the world,\u201d Xiao Han said with a laugh.\nLin Xiaowan still did not know how to paint with emotions. Perhaps this was the difference between her and professionals. She would paint based on her inspirations and her likes. Sometimes she liked the things she painted, and sometimes she would throw away the things she painted.\nXiao Han\u2019s other painting that was part of the exhibition depicted a garden. There were many colorful flowers, and the painting looked very lively. In the sky, the sun peeked out from behind the clouds. It was so realistic that it looked as though it was a photo.\nLin Xiaowan could not help but marvel at the painting. She sighed and said sincerely, \u201cYou\u2019re really amazing.\u201d\n\nXiao Han laughed it off and said, \u201cWhy are you comparing yourself to me? It\u2019s fine as long as you can surpass yourself. We\u2019re on different paths after all.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan nodded in agreement. She thought his words were reasonable.\nWhen they left, it was a little cloudy.\nLin Xiaowan checked the weather forecast and saw that there was a high chance that it would rain. For this reason, she wanted to go home as soon as possible. She did not like being outside when it rained.\nThe duo walked along the path in the garden that led to the parking lot. They had just taken a few steps when Lin Xiaowan saw Gu Yuwu.\nGu Yuwu was with a few men and women, and one of them was holding a camera. They seemed to be filming something.\nLin Xiaowan paused in her steps. She was not far from Gu Yuwu, and as long as Gu Yuwu turned slightly, she would be able to see Lin Xiaowan. She was not sure if she should go over and greet Gu Yuwu since Gu Yuwu seemed to be engrossed in filming.\nSeeing that Lin Xiaowan had stopped walking, Xiao Han asked in confusion, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan shook her head. Before she could reply, Gu Yuwu suddenly turned around and saw her.\nGu Yuwu waved at Lin Xiaowan. Before walking over, she said to the people around her, \u201cI\u2019m going to greet my friend.\u201d\nWhen Gu Yuwu walked over, she looked at Xiao Han for a moment before she asked Lin Xiaowan, \u201cThis is\u2026\u201d\nLin Xiaowan said, \u201cThis is Teacher Hong\u2019s student. We came to have a look at the art exhibition today.\u201d Then, she asked Gu Yuwu, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan and Gu Yuwu were standing out of frame at this moment. She saw a few people holding treats in their hands and a cage.\nGu Yuwu replied, \u201cCatching a cat. There\u2019s a stray cat here, and I\u2019m here to join in the fun.\u201d\n\u201cCatching a cat? Why are you filming it?\u201d\nGu Yuwu explained, \u201cThey\u2019re filming content for their social media accounts. They usually filmed themselves helping strays. That\u2019s what they\u2019re doing today.\u201d\nThe cat they were trying to catch today was a female stray cat. She had carried her kittens here. This was nothing.

However, the girl who reported this matter told them that the cat became aggressive and even attacked people after it had kittens. The residents nearby had complained about it due to its aggressive nature. If they did not catch the cat and bring it away, there was a possibility that the cat would be killed.\nAfter some consideration, they decided to bring the cat away. However, it was just as reported; the cat\u2019s temper was really quite\u2026 fierce. It looked weak and pitiful, but it would bend its back, and its hair would stand on ends as it hissed, looking as though it was going to attack at any given moment as soon as they approached.\n\u201cThe cat is hiding inside with her kittens. You can\u2019t see them now. I took a short video earlier so you can have a look,\u201d Gu Yuwu said.\nThe stray cat had white fur, and despite being dirty, it was very good-looking. Its eyes were big and green, and its ears were slender.\nLin Xiaowan, who had been drawing a lot recently, suddenly thought of a pitiful young woman with messy hair wearing a white dress when she looked at the cat. She thought to herself, \u2018Wow! I\u2019m really good at imagining things\u2026\u2019\nMeanwhile, the few people from the Animal Rescue Association were still trying to lure the cat out. However, it was extremely vigilant. It completely ignored the treats and the food in front of it.\nThis was Lin Xiaowan\u2019s first time seeing such a scene so she was a little reluctant to leave. She asked, \u201cCan I stay and take a look?\u201d\n\u201cOf course. I don\u2019t have anything to do today. Let\u2019s go for a meal later?\u201d Gu Yuwu replied. Then, she remembered that Lin Xiaowan came to look at the art exhibition so she looked at the time before she said, \u201cAt this time, you should be done with the art exhibition, right?\u201d\n\u201cYes, we were on the way to the underground parking lot actually,\u201d Lin Xiaowan said before she turned to Xiao Han and continued to say, \u201cSenior Brother, I won\u2019t leave with you.\u201d\nXiao Han looked at the sky worriedly before he said, \u201cAlright. However, the weather is bad. You guys should leave early.\u201d\nAfter Xiao Han left, Lin Xiaowan was worried she would disturb the live broadcast if she went over to take a look. She felt more at ease when she found out that they were only filming.\n\nThe white female cat sat next to her kittens as she looked around vigilantly. From time to time, it would comfort the kittens that were mewling.\nLin Xiaowan could not see clearly so she tiptoed to have a better look. She asked, \u201cHow many kittens are there?\u201d\nThe female cat had chosen to make its nest in a hole in the cement ground. There were pieces of rotten wood around the opening, slightly concealing the situation inside. It was dark and almost nothing could be seen.\nThe female stayed in the hole, refusing to come outside.\nPreviously, the rescuers had used a small torchlight to see the situation inside. However, the female cat was particularly sensitive to light so they only took a quick look.\nOne of the people replied to Lin Xiaowan, \u201cIt seems like there are three or four of them? However, I\u2019m not too sure since we didn\u2019t have a good look.\u201d\nJust as everyone was thinking of ways to lure the cat out, a slender Dragon Li cat with stripes suddenly walked toward the hole where the female cat and treats were.\nEveryone was slightly stunned.\n\u201cEh? Is this one a stray as well?\u201d\nThe rescuers observed the new cat for a moment.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so. It doesn\u2019t seem afraid of humans\u2026\u201d\nPreviously, the girl who reported this matter also said that there were a few domestic cats in the area. However, she was not sure if they belonged to a family or if they were raised collectively by the community.\nThe Dragon Li ate the cat food in a leisurely manner. After taking a few bites, it began to meow. It looked at everyone before it turned its attention to the female cat.\nNo one acted rashly and continued to observe the situation.\n\nAfter a while, someone speculated out loud, \u201cPerhaps the two cats know each other\u2026 After the Dragon Li cat came, the female cat didn\u2019t seem as nervous as before\u2026\u201d\nGu Yuwu laughed and chimed in, \u201cMaybe it\u2019s the father of the kitten! In fact, this Dragon Li cat is quite handsome!\u201d\nLin Xiaowan looked at the Dragon Li cat for a long time, but she still could not figure out its gender. She asked, \u201cHow can you tell its gender?\u201d\nGu Yuwu said with a smile, \u201c1 was just guessing as well.\u201d\nThe cats meowed at each other, and at this point, it was clear that they were familiar with each other. After a long time, the female cat finally raised its tail and deigned to take a few steps out of the hole. Its small steps were graceful and elegant, making it look just like a little lady. At the same time, it also did not forget to stare at the two-legged beasts around her.\nAfter dawdling for a long time, the female cat finally sat down next to the Dragon Li cat and lowered its head to eat. It had only taken two bites of the canned food when a clap of thunder rang in the sky. Shocked, it leaped up, but before it ran away, a huge net fell down and accurately captured it. The net did not only capture the female cat, but it captured the Dragon Li cat as well.\nThe rescuers also did not expect the net would come in handy at this moment.\nThe female cat kept struggling and crying while the rescuers put on gloves so they could carry it into the cage they had prepared.\nOn the contrary, the Dragon Li cat was like a little fool. It did not resist when it was carried, and it stared at everyone with its bright eyes in a daze as though it did not know what was happening.\nThe rescuer who was carrying the Dragon Li cat turned it around to have a look before he laughed and said, \u201cThis is also a female cat. It\u2019s not the kittens\u2019 father.\u201d\nThe thunder was like a warning. As soon as they had settled the two cats down, bean-sized raindrops began to fall. They barely had time to react before it rained heavily as the sounds of thunder continued to ring in the sky.\nGu Yuwu hurriedly pulled Lin Xiaowan away and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go to the car first.\u201d\n\u2018If Huo Zheng finds out that his beloved was drenched in the rain, it\u2019d be terrible\u2026\u2019\nLin Xiaowan, who was still thinking about the cats, said, \u201cAren\u2019t they going to bring the kittens away?\u201d\nAs soon as Lin Xiaowan\u2019s voice fell, the rescuers also completed the distribution of work.

The rain was so heavy that the Dragon Li cat was meowing miserably. On the other hand, the white cat sounded a little hoarse as it meowed tremblingly, which sounded pitiful and creepy at the same time.\nGu Yuwu grabbed Lin Xiaowan\u2019s hand and ran to the car.\nThe person who ran the fastest was rhe cameraman.

The car was parked near the entrance instead of the underground parking lot. She did not stop as she pulled Lin Xiaowan into the car.\nLin Xiaowan was panting from exhaustion after running. She gasped as she said, \u201cThere\u2019s no need to run so fast\u2026\u201d\nIt took a long time before her heartbeat returned to normal.\nThe rain was so sudden and heavy that a few of them were drenched. There was nothing to dry themselves with in the car so Gu Yuwu handed a few sheets of tissue and said, \u201cUse this first.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan wiped her face, still exhausted. \u201cGoodness! I\u2019m going to die from running so hard!\u201d\nGu Yuwu laughed mercilessly. \u201cYour physical strength isn\u2019t good enough. We only ran a short distance. 1 remember that after climbing the mountain, someone swore to exercise!\u201d\nLin Xiaowan felt guilty when she heard these words. She had long forgotten about her exercise plan. She only persisted for a few days before she gave up. On the first day; she felt like her plan was so strict and decided to make changes to her plan. However, after that, she did not go through with her plan. She felt ashamed when she thought about this.\nAt this time, Lin Xiaowan\u2019s phone rang. It was not affected by the rain at all. Although her expensive bag was not waterproof, it had two layers of protection. Unsurprisingly, the call was from Huo Zheng.\nSeeing that it was raining, Huo Zheng called to ask if Lin Xiaowan had gone home. He knew she was going to the art exhibition today.\n\u201cAre you still out?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. 1 ran into Sister Yuwu after the exhibition. A few people were rescuing strays so 1 stayed behind to watch.\u201d\nCurrently, Lin Xiaowan no longer felt awkward about addressing Gu Yuwu as Sister Yuwu\u2019.\nAfter listening to Lin Xiaowan, Huo Zheng looked outside the window. Dark clouds gathered in the sky, making it dark. Although it was only 4 PM, it looked as though it was already 7 or 8 PM.\nAfter a moment, Huo Zheng asked, slightly worried, \u201cAre you drenched?\u201d\nHe knew she would definitely catch a cold if she ran around in wet clothes.\nLin Xiaowan knew that he was going to lecture her so she said vaguely, \u201cI\u2019m in the car with Sister Yuwu.\u201d\nIt was true that she was in the car, but she did not say if she was in the car before or after it rained.\nHuo Zheng looked at the time again before he said, \u201c1 11 tell the cook to boil some ginger soup for you. Remember to change your clothes if it\u2019s wet.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan could hear the disapproval in his voice, but she did not complain. Instead, she said, \u201cAlright. I\u2019ll do it later. There are quite a few people in the car.\u201d\nHuo Zheng asked where she was going, but she did not know either. She asked Gu Yuwu before she gave Huo Zheng the address of the Animal Rescue Association.\n\u201cSomeone will send you clothes there.\u201d\n\u201cBring a set for Sister Yuwu too!\u201d\n\u201cAlright,\u201d Huo Zheng said helplessly.\nWhen Lin Xiaowan ended the call, a rescuer returned with the kittens. Her attention was immediately diverted, and she leaned over to have a look.\nThere were four thin and weak kittens. Although they were wrapped in a blanket, they were still wet from the rain, causing their fur to stick to their bodies. They huddled together and cried intermittently. Who knew if they were cold or frightened, but they were trembling violently? All in all, they looked extremely pitiful.\n\u201cUh! They\u2019re not pure white!\u201d Lin Xiaowan exclaimed.\n\nOne of them even looked like a little black mouse.\nThe kittens were very young. Xo one could tell now if there was anything wrong with them. They were quickly placed with their mother.\nPerhaps the white cat was tired or perhaps it no longer sensed danger, but it had stopped howling.\nThe Animal Rescue Association was different from what Lin Xiaowan had imagined. It was quite near the art gallery, and it occupied a large area. A cute signboard that read The Loving Home of Pets\u2019 hung at the door.\nAt this time, it was no longer as dark as before. The rain was also much lighter even if it was windy. However, the temperature had dropped a lot.\nThere was no umbrella in the car so the driver drove to the entrance directly so they could run into the building.\nA gray Mulsanne with both indicators flashing was parked near the entrance as well.\nAt this time, one of the rescuers who was about to open the door noticed the other car. \u201cHmm? Why do we have visitors at this time? Did we have an appointment with someone who wants to adopt a stray?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan, who was looking at the kittens, turned around as soon as she heard these words. She saw the license plate and confirmed that it was Huo Zheng\u2019s car.\nWhen Gu Yuwu saw the car, she commented, \u201cWow, your boyfriend is really fast!\u201d\nLin Xiaowan did not recognize the person who got out of Huo Zheng\u2019s car with a black umbrella, but the other party seemed to know her. He greeted her first before he handed her a paper bag. He said that there was a thermos of ginger soup that Huo Zheng had instructed him to buy when he was on the way here.\nThe thermos was huge, and there was enough for the soup to go around. Everyone had a small bowl each, but there was still some left in the end.\nThe kittens were given a quick basic examination. Apart from being slightly malnourished and having ear mites, they were healthy. After drying up and drinking their fill, they closed their eyes and fell asleep.\nMeanwhile, rhe female cat was quiet during the journey here, but as soon as she entered the door and was taken care of, it turned aggressive immediately. It was rather heartless and scratched the vet when the vet was examining it.\nLin Xiaowan crouched down and looked at the kittens. They were very fluffy after they were dried. She stroked them gently and thought about raising a cat.\nThe kittens were almost three months old, but they looked small due to a lack of nutrition. Their bones were quite prominent.\nOnly the Dragon Li cat and the kittens were placed in the cattery. The white cat was placed in the observation room alone not only because of its aggressive behavior but also because it was showing symptoms of a fungal infection..\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

One of them was carrying the Dragon Li cat while the other was busy keying in information about the cats on the computer. No one knew if the Dragon Li cat was a stray cat or a domestic cat, and it did not have any distinct marks on its body. For this reason, when the weather improved tomorrow or the day after tomorrow, they would have to return to ask the people nearby.\nA few of them gathered to name the kittens. Since they could not determine when they were born, the Animal Rescue Association gave the kittens small identity rings according to their sizes. There were four of them, and the youngest one was a female with gray and black fur.\nAs for the other three kittens, they were males.\nThe female kitten looked the most unkempt among the four kittens. Its fur was messy, and even after it was cleaned and dried, its fur was fuzzy, just like a dandelion. It was not as beautiful as its siblings. In fact, it could even be said that it was a little\u2026 ugly\u2026 but cute.\nThe prettiest one was the second kitten, which resembled a little cow. Its face and body were round, and it was also the liveliest. When they were drying it, it kept jumping around and meowing. They named it Little Cow even though it was not a moo cat.\nThe female kitten was given the name Little Chestnut because its coat resembled that of fried chestnut.\nLin Xiaowan really wanted to adopt Little Chestnut. Its personality was the complete opposite of that of Little Cow. From the moment it got into the car to the Animal Rescue Association, it did not struggle nor did it make it sound when it was held. When they let go of it, it would curl up silently at the side.\nLin Xiaowan found Little Chestnut adorable so she took a photo and sent it to Huo Zheng.\n[Lin Xiaowan: 1 want to raise a cat! Can I raise a cat? *crying emoji*]\nThey were looking for people to adopt the kittens. Lin Xiaowan thought about her condition and felt that she met the requirements. It should be okay for her to raise a cat. Nonetheless, she still had to ask for Huo Zheng\u2019s opinion. If Huo Zheng disagreed, then she would give up on this idea.\nUnexpectedly, Huo Zheng was focused on another matter.\n[Huo Zheng: Did you change your clothes? It just rained. Don\u2019t turn on the air conditioner. It\u2019s easy to catch a cold.]\nIt was already the beginning of autumn. Although it was windy and raining outside, the temperature was quite high. It was impossible not to turn on the air conditioner.\nLin Xiaowan replied, playing dumb.\n\n[Lin Xiaowan: Yes, I\u2019ve already changed my clothes. Hurry up and looked at the photo of the kitten I sent you! ]\nAfter a moment, Huo Zheng replied.\n[Huo Zheng: It\u2019s up to you. If you like it, then you can raise it.]\nHuo Zheng never had any interest in these things so he did not have any opinions about it. However, he thought it would be good for Lin Xiaowan to raise a cat since it could cultivate her sense of responsibility.\nHe enlarged the photo that Lin Xiaowan sent him and looked at it carefully before putting it away.\nWith this, Lin Xiaowan knew that Huo Zheng had agreed to her request. She looked for someone from the Animal Rescue Association and happily expressed her intention of adopting a kitten.\nUpon hearing this, Gu Yuwu stroked her chin and said, \u201cThat\u2019s great. I can visit you next time to play with the kitten.\u201d\nThe staff members of the Animal Rescue Association had a good impression of Lin Xiaowan. One of them asked, \u201cHave you ever raised a cat before? Do you have any experience?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan\u2019s living conditions were not very good in the past. It was difficult for her to raise herself, let alone raise a cat. How could she have any experience? She could only shake her head and replied truthfully, \u201cNo.\u201d\nHowever, this was not a dealbreaker. It did not matter even if she did not have experience.\nThe staff member asked a few more questions such as if she was living alone or with others, if she was allowed to raise pets at home, and so on. As for her living environment and finances, the staff member was not very worried. After all, they had seen the clothes that Huo Zheng had sent her. The clothes were clearly expensive. With one look, one could tell that Lin Xiaowan\u2019s living conditions were not bad. It was definitely not a problem for her to raise a cat, finance-wise.\nThe staff member was more concerned about another matter.\n\u201cYou can be impulsive when raising pets. You have to be responsible for your pet. It might be naughty, and it might also get sick. You\u2019ll have to take care of it\u2026\u201d\nLin Xiaowan replied seriously, \u201cI think 1 can do it.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s also another important thing. We\u2019ll have to visit our adopted cats and dogs occasionally. Are you okay with this?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan did not think there was anything wrong with this so she nodded and said, \u201cYes!\u201d\nThe other party asked, \u201cSo which one do you want to adopt?\u201d\n\nLin Xiaowan pointed at the kitten and said, \u201cLittle Chestnut.\u201d\nAfter that, the other party told Lin Xiaowan that they would help her care for the kitten temporarily and could not give it to her immediately. After all, not only did Lin Xiaowan not have the necessary things to raise the kitten now, but the kitten was also a little weak. It had to be kept under observation for a while. Moreover, it was likely that Lin Xiaowan did not know how to take care of such a small and weak kitten.\nBefore signing the adoption agreement, she was also told that the Animal Rescue Association would visit her house in person.\nLin Xiaowan quickly messaged Huo Zheng, relaying everything to him.\nIt did not take long before he replied.\n[Huo Zheng: You can decide on these matters.]\nHuo Zheng did not care about matters like this and felt that Lin Xiaowan could do whatever she wanted as long as she was happy.\nThe weather was not good today, and it was already getting late. It was definitely not appropriate for a home visit today. For this reason, she scheduled the home visit for another day.\nLin Xiaowan\u2019s initial plan to have dinner with Gu Yuwu alone was canceled. Since it was still raining, they ordered food and ate at the Animal Rescue Association.\nTwo days later.\nWhen the weather took a turn for the better, Lin Xiaowan received a call from the Animal Rescue Association asking if they could visit today.\n\u201cOf course, you can. I\u2019ll inform the security guard after this. What\u2019s your license plate number?\u201d\nThe vehicles that entered Lin Xiaowan\u2019s neighborhood were strictly checked. Unregistered vehicles were prohibited from entering.\nThe two members of the Animal Rescue Association who came to visit were also the ones who named the kittens the other day. They were quite familiar with Lin Xiaowan and were very friendly when they met.\nAs soon as they arrived, they knew that there was no problem with Lin Xiaowan\u2019s living environment.\nShengjing was a place where every inch of land was expensive. Considering the size of her house and the location of her house, which was in the city center, the kitten would surely live a good life as long as Lin Xiaowan was willing to spend time taking care of it.\nLin Xiaowan showed the duo the space she had set up for the kitten in the living room. A scratching post and a variety of toys could be seen.\n\u201cI haven\u2019t bought the cat litter, cat food, and the like. I planned to buy those things when I pick up the cat\u2026\u201d\nSince the Animal Rescue Association sold all kinds of pet necessities, Lin Xiaowan planned to buy everything in one go when she picked up the kitten..\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

We have a partnership with the hospital. Do you know where that is? It\u2019s not too far from here\u2026\u201d\nAfter that, the other party added, \u201cNaturally, this is just a suggestion. You can choose to go to another vet\u2026\u201d\nThe Furry Love Veterinary Hospital was a partner of the Animal Rescue Association. Previously, the Animal Rescue Association had filmed a cute pet documentary there.\nThe hospital was very big; it had three floors. It was located at the intersection, and the huge blue and white signboard was very eye-catching.\nLin Xiaowan nodded. \u201cI know where it is. Its location is very convenient.\u201d\nApart from finalizing the adoption today, the duo from the Animal Rescue Association also had another small request.\nOne of them explained, \u201cThere\u2019s another matter. We\u2019re quite active on social media. Recently, we posted a video of the rescue. After that, we received a message from someone who also wanted to adopt Little Chestnut. We said that Little Chestnut has already been adopted, but the person said that he was willing to pay for Little Chestnut. The problem is that someone then commented that everything was just an act to raise the price of Little Chestnut.\u201d\n\u201cWe were wondering if we could film a short video of you and Little Chestnut when you bring it home. At that time, we\u2019ll also film us finalizing and signing the adoption agreement to prove ourselves.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan did not have much of a problem with this, but she was concerned about one thing. She said, \u201c1 feel a bit shy to be on camera. However, I\u2019m fine with it as long as you mosaic my face and name on the agreement.\u201d\nSince they planned to use this as evidence, the agreement would naturally be shown to everyone.\n\u201cOf course. This is a matter of your privacy after all.\u201d\nIn fact, Lin Xiaowan really could not understand the minds of those people who commented on the video. After all, they did not mention money at all during the entire process. However, just because someone expressed their willingness to pay for Little Chestnut, the matter blew up.\n\n\u2018How strange\u2026\u2019\nLin Xiaowan was also not sure if the short video would be able to solve this matter. After all, if those people really wanted to look for trouble, they would not believe it no matter what. Moreover, it was likely that they would be even more skeptical since her face and name would be hidden.\nIn any case, Lin Xiaowan did not express her opinion to the duo. In any case, it was not a big problem, and it did not matter to her. After that, she asked about the Dragon Li cat and Little Chestnut\u2019s mother.\n\u201cThe mother has yet to recover from her fungal infection so she\u2019s still living in isolation in the small room,\u201d one of them said, \u201cShe\u2019s still very vigilant and wary. It\u2019s as though she thinks we\u2019re bad people. Every time we checked on her or applied medicine for her, she\u2019d struggle and scratch us. It didn\u2019t help when we showed her the kittens as well. She has a really bad temper\u2026\u201d\n\u201cAs for the Dragon Li cat. We\u2019re also looking for someone to adopt it. We returned to the place we found her and asked around; we confirmed that it\u2019s also a stray cat. It only appeared recently. However, seeing how docile it was and how it didn\u2019t seem afraid of us, we suspect that it had an owner before. We just don\u2019t know if it was abandoned or if it ran away\u2026\u201d\nAfter a while, the chef and a few of his students arrived with all the ingredients needed for today. When he saw so many people, he asked, \u201cShould I make more food for dinner tonight?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan invited the duo to stay for dinner, but they refused her politely. She could not help but feel slightly regretful. After all, the chef was a master of various cuisines; his skills were top-notch. She felt that it was a pity that they could not eat the food he cooked.\nSeeing that the chef was about to get busy, the duo felt that it was not appropriate to stay any longer. They rose to their feet and prepared to leave.\nAs the host, Lin Xiaowan saw them out.\nWhen the duo arrived at the entrance, they saw shoes, which clearly belonged to a man. With this, they remembered that Lin Xiaowan was living with her boyfriend.\nOne of them asked worriedly, \u201cYour boyfriend isn\u2019t home? Is he okay with cats?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan smiled brightly and replied, \u201cYes. I\u2019ve already spoken to him about this!\u201d\nPreviously, she had decided to custom-make the scratching post, and she had asked Huo Zheng about it. At that time, he had said, \u201cThat\u2019s a good idea. You can do whatever you want.\u201d\nDespite how perfunctory his reply sounded, seeing how serious Lin Xiaowan was, he also listened very attentively.\nBefore they left, Lin Xiaowan asked, \u201cCan 1 go over to visit the kitten?\u201d\nHuo Zheng had never seen Little Chestnut before so he did not know how cute it was. In her opinion, once he saw it, he definitely would not be so indifferent anymore/\n\nThe duo naturally had no objections.\n\u201cOf course, you can come anytime. We have people there every day.\u201d\nA few days later.\nWhen Huo Zheng and Lin Xiaowan visited the Animal Rescue Association in the afternoon, the kittens had just returned from getting their vaccination shots.\nThe Dragon Li cat lived in the same room as the kittens. At this time, it was wearing an Elizabethan collar around its neck. Just as the others said, it was really not afraid of humans at all. As soon as Lin Xiaowan entered the room, it meowed affectionately and rubbed itself against her leg as though it was welcoming her. After that, it jumped to the side to play.\nWhen Lin Xiaowan saw the Elizabethan collar, she asked curiously, \u201cWhy is she wearing that thing?\u201d\n\u201cShe was spayed two days ago. The collar is to prevent her from licking or biting her wounds,\u201d the staff member said with a smile.\nAt this time, the staff member finally noticed the tall and handsome man dressed in a suit standing next to Lin Xiaowan.\nSeeing this, Huo Zheng nodded slightly as a greeting. Then, he shifted his attention back to Lin Xiaowan who had run off to play with the cats.\nLife at the Animal Rescue Association was good for the kittens. They ate well and slept well. In just a few days, they had grown visibly.\nLin Xiaowan\u2019s heart softened immediately when she saw the kittens.\n\u201cThey grew so fast! They\u2019re much cuter and healthier now!\u201d\n\u2018Cats grow and change just like humans!\u2019\n\u201cCan I carry them?\u201d\n\u201cOf course, you can. Moreover, the kittens\u2019 claws aren\u2019t that sharp yet so you don\u2019t have to worry. However, after bringing Little Chestnut back, don\u2019t forget to trim her nails regularly.\u201d\nSince Lin Xiaowan arrived, she had completely thrown Huo Zheng to the back of her mind.\nSeeing that she had no intention of making introductions, the staff member felt that it was a little awkward.. As such, she asked, \u201cThis person is\u2026\u201d\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

She said, \u201cOh, this is my boyfriend. He came with me to see the kitten!\u201d With this, the members of the Animal Rescue Association finally had a chance to say hello to Huo Zheng.\nHuo Zheng nodded politely and stood silently next to Lin Xiaowan. He watched Lin Xiaowan play with Little Chestnut, and a hint of a smile could be seen in his gaze.\nHowever, when the people from the Animal Rescue Association saw how aloof Huo Zheng was, they could not help but wonder if he was really okay with raising a cat.\n\u2018Why does he look like he doesn\u2019t like cats? Look, the kittens are meowing and taking the initiative to rub against his legs, but he\u2019s completely indifferent to them. He didn\u2019t even spare them a glance! He\u2019s just staring at his girlfriend!\u2019\nIndeed, while almost everyone\u2019s attention was on the cats, Huo Zheng was only staring at Lin Xiaowan.\n\u2018Alright, his girlfriend likes cats, and he likes his girlfriend. In a way, it can be considered that he likes cats as well\u2026\u2019\nThe members of the Animal Rescue Association silently convinced themselves before they asked Lin Xiaowan if they could film a short video.\nLin Xiaowan did not want to let go of the kitten. She held Little Chestnut in her arms as she crouched down to play with the others. Even the Dragon Li cat came to her side and played with her.\nShe was a little taken aback when she heard the question. When she recovered, she asked, \u201cWhat are we filming? The signing of the adoption agreement?\u201d\n\u2018Didn\u2019t they say that they wanted to film at the house when 1 bring the kitten back?\u2019\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that. We just want to film both of you playing and interacting with the cats.\u201d\nThe staff member who spoke was a young girl. Perhaps it was her first time doing this, she looked a little embarrassed.\n\u201cIt\u2019ll just take a few minutes. We plan to edit it and post it with our daily videos\u2026\u201d\n\nAlthough the young girl did not say it explicitly, Lin Xiaowan knew that it was likely to prove that she was really adopting the kitten and that the entire thing was not staged. At this time, she really felt that it was really tiring to face those netizens on the Internet.\nThe Animal Rescue Association was clearly doing a good deed. Not only were there no benefits, but they also had to justify themselves and prove themselves to others.\nSeeing that Lin Xiaowan was silent, the young girl quickly said, \u201cI won\u2019t show your faces. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan did not mind, but she did not know how Huo Zheng would feel about it. She tilted her head and asked, \u201cBrother, do you mind?\u201d\nThe first rule was to address Huo Zheng as \u2018Brother\u2019 when she wanted something. Otherwise, she would only address him as Huo Zheng.\nHow could Huo Zheng refuse her when it was such a trivial matter? He smiled gently and asked, \u201cWhen have I ever said no to you?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan scoffed disdainfully, showing her disbelief. She said, \u201cIt has happened many, many times. For example, at noon today, I said I wanted to eat desserts, but you said no.\u201d\nHuo Zheng raised an eyebrow and looked at her.\nThey had lunch near Huo Zheng\u2019s company earlier. After lunch, the waiter brought the dessert menu over. When Lin Xiaowan said that she wanted to have the mango ice cream, he had refused her. In the end, she had to pick something else.\nAlthough it was for her own good, Lin Xiaowan was very self-righteous. She felt that she was completely in the right. As for Huo Zheng, he naturally gave in to her and accepted that he was in the wrong, regardless if he was right or wrong.\nWhen the young girl from the Animal Rescue Association saw this scene, the tiny doubt in her heart also vanished.\n\u2018What\u2019s there to worry about? It doesn\u2019t matter at all if he likes cats or not. As long as his girlfriend likes them, it\u2019ll be fine.\u2019\nThe person who filmed the video was the same person who was filming when they were rescuing the cats. He was mainly responsible for the association\u2019s social media.\nJust as the young girl said earlier, the filming was very short. When it ended, he said, \u201cWe\u2019ll be posting this on Speaker and Bobo Star. Do you have accounts? Do you want me to tag you?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan thought about her Speaker and Bobo Star accounts. Previously, she had signed up for Bobo Star because of Gu Yuwu. Her account only followed Gu Yuwu, and she did not post anything at all. Apart from watching Gu Yuwu\u2019s videos, she did not really use Bobo Star. She thought that this was a good chance for her to use it.\nShe gave her username, which was \u2018I\u2019m Lin Xiaowan, to the other party, and they began to follow each other.\n\nBefore Little Chestnut arrived, Lin Xiaowan went shopping with her sister-in-law, Qiao You\u2019an. Hong Minhua\u2019s daughter-in-law, Mrs. Zheng, also joined them.\nWhile they were chatting, Mrs. Zheng also invited Lin Xiaowan to attend Hong Minhua\u2019s birthday party.\nIt was only then did Lin Xiaowan know that Hong Minhua\u2019s birthday was coming up.\n\u201cIt\u2019s so sudden! 1 had lessons yesterday, but Grandma Hong didn\u2019t say anything about it to me!\u201d Lin Xiaowan said with a pout. She puffed her cheeks up just like a pufferfish.\nMrs. Zheng chuckled and pinched her cheek before she said, \u201cShe probably forgot to tell you. A few days ago, she said that she was going to personally deliver the invitation to you.\u201d\nHong Minhua was turning 66 years old.\nThis was the first time Lin Xiaowan was celebrating the birthday of someone at Hong Minhua\u2019s age. Not only was Hong Minhua her teacher, but she was also very close to Hong Minhua. As such, it was only natural for her to give Hong Minhua a birthday present. However, after thinking about it, she still could not figure out what to give Hong Minhua.\nWhen she asked Huo Zheng about it, he also did not know the answer to her question. In the end, he said, \u201cJust let Assistant Song handle this.\u201d\nAssistant Song had been working for Huo Zheng for many years. He knew what kind of gifts were given at social events like this. Previously, he was also the one who handled Hong Minhua\u2019s birthday gifts.\nHowever, Lin Xiaowan refused Huo Zheng\u2019s suggestion. She said, \u201cAssistant Song can help you prepare your gift, but I\u2019ll handle mine on my own. I can\u2019t be perfunctory about her gift.\u201d\nHuo Zheng chuckled. \u201cPerfunctory?\u201d\n\u201cGrandma Hong is very kind to me. It feels insincere if I let Assistant Song help me get a gift for her. It\u2019s not appropriate\u2026\u201d\nSeeing that Lin Xiaowan was very serious, Huo Zheng said helpfully, \u201cThen why don\u2019t you ask her which painter she likes? Maybe you can give her a painting.\u201d\nThe painting naturally could not be casually bought. It had to be meaningful and special.\nLin Xiaowan thought it was a good idea. However, after a beat, she asked, \u201cWon\u2019t be it too obvious if 1 ask her this?\u201d\nHuo Zheng laughed. \u201cQingqing, are you still planning to surprise her?\u201d\nIn his opinion, since Lin Xiaowan was going to give Hong Minhua a gift anyway, it did not make a difference if Hong Minhua knew it in advance or\nnot..\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

If you already know what it is, there won\u2019t be any joy in receiving gifts,\u201d Lin Xiaowan said.\nIt was the first time Huo Zheng had heard such words, and he found them refreshing. Then he recalled that whenever he received gifts from Lin Xiaowan in the past, they had always been a surprise.\nThe next day, Huo Zheng had arranged for someone to inquire about Hong Minima\u2019s preference. After obtaining the information, he passed it over to Lin Xiaowan.\nAlthough Hong Minhua was getting on in years, her hands were steady, and her eyes were bright. When she had the time, she would occasionally practice calligraphy. As such, she also collected calligraphy paintings. It was a good idea to take this into consideration when buying a gift for her.\nLin Xiaowan was not familiar with calligraphy at all. The paintings that Hong Minhua collected were not ordinary. Moreover, the calligraphy paintings the latter collected were painted using traditional ink sticks that were ground on inkstones.\nIt was not easy to find good calligraphy paintings. Those really precious ones were antiques, likely already in the possessions of collectors or museums.\nNonetheless, Lin Xiaowan did not let Huo Zheng help her and took full responsibility. She did some research and found a lot of information. However, good calligraphy paintings were really hard to find, and she barely found one that she was satisfied with. However, it was being auctioned off overseas. The time of the auction was inconvenient as well. As such, although there were only two days left, she still had no clue at all.\nSeeing that she was troubled, Huo Zheng suggested, \u201cThe paintings, the \u2018Auspicious Sun on Mount Lu\u2019 and \u2018Beautiful Snow on a Winter Night\u2019, that you showed before are very good. They\u2019re worth collecting, and they\u2019re also in line with Elder Hong\u2019s taste.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan sighed and said with a pout, \u201cAlright. If 1 can\u2019t find anything else by today, 1\u201911 look at those paintings.\u201d\nThe two paintings were put up for sale, and Lin Xiaowan saw them by chance previously. She had shown them to Huo Zheng and also spoke with the seller. However, after considering it, she took a step back.\nSometimes, things just happened coincidentally. When Gu Yuwu learned that Lin Xiaowan was looking for calligraphy paintings recently, she sent Lin Xiaowan a couple of photos in the afternoon.\n\nThe photo was that of a calligraphy painting. There was a square stamp with round edges at the bottom, and the words \u2018A Hundred Years of Longevity\u2019 were written on both sides in beautiful calligraphy. The bottom was slightly worn, but this was not a problem at all.\n[Gu Yuwu: Do you like this piece? It was made by Wu Shenbo during the Wanli era of the Ming Dynasty. It\u2019s definitely authentic.]\nLin Xiaowan had done a lot of research so she knew who Wu Shenbo was. He was a calligrapher who was on par with the famous Cheng J unfang. There was almost no historical record of Wu Shenbo, and his works were even rarer.\nLin Xiaowan was naturally excited.\n[Lin Xiaowan: Wow! Wow! Wow! Where did you find this? I think it\u2019s great! Is this from a private collection? Hurry up and tell me!]\nIt could be seen by the three exclamation marks that she was excited.\nGu Yuwu wanted to save the trouble so she called Lin Xiaowan immediately.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a charity auction tonight. The work belongs to a celebrity who\u2019s putting it up for auction. A booklet of all the auction items was distributed earlier\u2026\u201d Gu Yuwu said, \u201cThis came at just the right time for you. I\u2019ll check the celebrity\u2019s background after this. There shouldn\u2019t be any problem.\u201d\nThe celebrity had not been in the entertainment industry for long, and her background was clean. It did not take long for Gu Yuwu to obtain the information.\nAfter calling Lin Xiaowan back, Gu Yuwu said, \u201cToday\u2019s charity auction will be broadcasted live. I don\u2019t know the reason for it, but if you attend, you might be caught on camera.\u201d\nGu Yuwu knew that Lin Xiaowan did not want to show her face, especially at such a public event. As such, she quickly made this matter clear to Lin Xiaowan before anything else.\nAs expected, Lin Xiaowan hesitated briefly when she heard these words. However, she soon decided that it was not a big problem. No one knew her, and even if they knew her, who cared who she was?\nIn any case, she was not afraid of being seen by others now. If people talked about her, then so be it. As long as they did not do it in front of her, she would pretend not to know anything. There was no need for her to overthink this matter and create trouble for herself.\nShe was no longer bothered by things like that. She was upright, and there was nothing for her to be afraid of. If anyone dared to do anything unreasonable, she would deal with it.\n\nMoreover, there would be a lot of people in attendance. She might not even be filmed. After all, many celebrities would attend the charity auction. Whether it was a live broadcast or not, the cameras would definitely follow the celebrities.\nLin Xiaowan was quite self-aware. Who would film her for no reason? At most, the camera would sweep past her when filming Gu Yuwu.\nLater in the evening.\nAfter Lin Xiaowan called and informed Huo Zheng about this matter, he, who was still busy with work, asked someone to send the invitation to Lin Xiaowan.\nLin Xiaowan asked in confusion, \u201cThis is the entertainment industry\u2019s charity auction. Why does the Huo family have an invitation to this kind of event?\u201d \u201cHmm? What do you mean by \u2018your Huo family\u2019?\u201d Huo Zheng chided gently.\nLin Xiaowan amended her words and said, \u201cOh, does our family have business in the entertainment industry?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Huo Zheng replied.\nWhether it was the entertainment industry or not, it was only natural that someone like Huo Zheng received an invitation. Although it was a charity auction, many connections could be established during the event.\nHowever, usually, Huo Zheng did not attend these events.\nWhen they arrived at the venue of the auction at night, Lin Xiaowan realized that her invitation was different from that of Gu Yuwu.\nThe staff member was also taken aback when he saw Lin Xiaowan\u2019s invitation. He did not expect such a young woman to hold an investor\u2019s invitation card. His attitude changed immediately, and he prepared to lead Lin Xiaowan to the VIP seats.\nGu Yuwu had already expected this when Lin Xiaowan told her that Huo Zheng had sent an invitation card to her. She raised her hand to stop the staff member and said, \u201cNo need. She\u2019s with me. We won\u2019t sit there.\u201d\nThe seats were naturally different for different invitation cards.\nGu Yuwu naturally had sat in the VIP seats for investors before. However, she found it boring. The only advantage was that it was very private.\nMeanwhile, Lin Xiaowan was not sure how much the calligraphy painting would cost. After all, it was an auction. Hence, she brought out Huo Zheng\u2019s black card for the second time. The last time she used it was when she went shopping with Qiao You\u2019an after she was reborn..\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

He Keeps Increasing the Bid by\nOnly 1,000 Yuan\nTranslator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation\nThere were many people exchanging greetings in the auction hall.\nLin Xiaowan instinctively held Gu Yuwu\u2019s hand. In a crowd, she had a long-standing habit of grabbing the arm or holding the hand of the person she was with.\nGu Yuwu did not find this strange. There was nothing wrong with holding hands after all. She said, \u201cLet\u2019s go to the front where we can see the auction clearly.\u201d\nAfter picking a good seat, Lin Xiaowan looked around curiously.\nThe venue was beautifully decorated, and the auction had yet to start. Many people were chatting in groups of twos and threes.\nAfter the person who came to greet Gu Yuwu left, Lin Xiaowan leaned over. It was quite quiet although there were many people so she lowered her voice and asked, \u201cThis is very different from the auctions I looked up online.\u201d\nThere was a huge stage and many LED screens in the hall. Many cameras were also set up all over the place. Instead of an auction, it looked more like a party.\nGu Yuwu smiled. \u201cDon\u2019t forget that there are many celebrities in attendance today. It\u2019s a charity auction, but putting on a show is also important for them. Nonetheless, it doesn\u2019t matter. In the end, the money will go to charity\u2026\u201d\nLin Xiaowan was deep in thought.\nWhile they sat in their seats, an endless stream of people came over to greet Gu Yuwu. Some of them were people Lin Xiaowan had seen in movies or dramas, and some of them she did not recognize at all.\nWhen the auction was about to start, Lin Xiaowan saw a woman who was vaguely familiar. She touched Gu Yuwu\u2019s arm and asked, \u201cLook over there. Isn\u2019t she that person who wore a similar dress as mine a while ago?\u201d\nGu Yuwu turned to have a look.\nIndeed, it was Sang Xiyue. She was wearing a long white dress with blue flowers today. Her long black was flowing and glossy. A faint smile could be seen on her face; although it looked perfunctory, the arc was just right and beautiful.\nLin Xiaowan took a few more glances. After a moment, she said, \u201cShe doesn\u2019t look as unpleasant as before\u2026\u201d\n\nLin Xiaowan did not know how to describe her feelings either. This kind of thing was very abstract, to begin with. In any case, now that she saw the other party again, she felt that the other party did not look as scheming as before. The other party looked no different from the elder sister next door.\nGu Yuwu remarked indifferently, \u201cShe probably learned her lesson\u2026\u201d\nAfter Sang Xiyue was exposed for wearing a knockoff, she lost almost all of her endorsement deals, especially her fashion endorsement deals. Needless to say, this created a huge obstacle in her career.\nSang Xiyue\u2019s temper was not good, to begin with. She was also not very good at doing things. When the scandal broke out, many people seized the opportunity and struck while she was down, exposing the truth. As a result, her popularity fell sharply.\nGu Yuwu also knew that lluo Zheng must have intervened at that time. Otherwise, Sang Xiyue would not have fallen so quickly. The latter had no support, resources, and no skills. For a long time, she disappeared from the public\u2019s eye.\nThis time, it was likely that Sang Xiyue wanted to use the name of charity to gain some favorable points for herself.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about her. Just watch the show.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan looked away.\nThe live broadcast had already begun. After a long speech, the auctioneer did not come on stage. Instead, someone came up to perform.\nLin Xiaowan found this puzzling.\n\u2018Isn\u2019t this an auction? Why is there a performance?\u2019\nThe calligraphy painting Lin Xiaowan wanted would be put up for auction rather early. She was not interested in the singing and dancing at all. Finally, after a while, the auction finally started.\nWhen it was time for Lin Xiaowan to bid, she hurriedly put her auction paddle up.\nThe starting bid for Wu Shenbo\u2019s Longevity painting started at slightly over 80,000. Lin Xiaowan had some research before this, and she knew the price could be considered cheap. However, she did not expect to successfully bid for it in just a few tries. She knew that people would keep bidding for it until it reached a high price.\nThe other party only increased the bid slightly. When she bid for 150,000, the other party would bid 151,000; when she bid 200,000, the other party would bid 201,000. Even when she increased the bid to 220,000, the other party only increased the bid by 1,000 yuan.\nLin Xiaowan rolled her eyes, feeling speechless. She raised her bid, and as expected, the other party followed. She could not help but feel annoyed, wondering if the other party was toying with her.\n\u201cIs this person crazy? He keeps increasing the bid by only 1,000 yuan! Is he toying with me?\u201d\nGu Yuwu turned around and saw the other party was a young man dressed in casual clothes. He looked extremely uncomfortable, and his face was a little red. He raised his paddle and leaned to the side slightly to talk to the person next to him.\n\nThe person on his left was a bald middle-aged man wearing glasses. He looked kind, but Gu Yuwu thought he looked a little pretentious.\nLin Xiaowan raised her paddle. This time, she increased the bid by 1,000 yuan as well. She was annoyed. She could feel everyone\u2019s curious gazes on her at this time.\nGu Yuwu frowned and said, \u201cIt\u2019s a young boy. I\u2019ve never seen him before so I don\u2019t know who he is either\u2026\u201d\nBased on his casual attire, it was likely that he was not from the entertainment industry.\nAfter a while, the calligraphy painting was finally auctioned off at 337,000 yuan. In the end, it still fell into Lin Xiaowan\u2019s hands. The other party finally stopped bidding.\nLin Xiaowan, who was fed up, turned to look at the other party. Based on Gu Yuwu\u2019s description, she easily found the young man who was dressed casually. When she saw the other party, she was momentarily stunned, and her anger had nowhere to go.\n\u201cMy goodness, he looks underage! His face is so red, and he looks like he\u2019s about to cry! Did he cry because he failed to bid for the painting? It can\u2019t be right?\u201d Lin Xiaowan asked in slight disbelief.\nHowever, in the next moment, Lin Xiaowan\u2019s expression turned a little smug as she said, \u201cHmph! Cry then. It\u2019s useless anyway. That thing is mine now!\u201d\nAfter the auction for the painting ended, they still had to go through the payment process before they could get their hands on the item. Hence, although they had achieved their goal, they still could not leave yet.\nAt some point, Lin Xiaowan\u2019s attention was caught by a bottle of red wine.\nWhen Gu Yuwu saw her raising her paddle, she asked, \u201cWhy are you bidding for the red wine?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan looked at the booklet in her hand, which was opened to the page of the red wine. She said, \u201c1 know this wine. When I spent the new year at the old residence, we had this wine.\u201d\nThe age of the wine that was being auctioned off was not as old as the one she had so Lin Xiaowan was not particularly anxious about it. Moreover, although the wine was rare, it was still in circulation.\nLin Xiaowan continued to say with a smile, \u201cI want to buy it for Huo Zheng. The Mid-Autumn Festival is approaching. We can drink it at that time.\u201d\nThis time, it was different from when she was bidding for the calligraphy painting where only two people were bidding. Many people were interested in the wine so there were many people bidding for it.\nAfter a few rounds, Lin Xiaowan stopped bidding for it. She propped her chin up with one hand, feeling bored.\n\u201cWhy did you stop?\u201d\n\u201cLet them bid for a while first..\u201d\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

As society developed faster and faster, live broadcasts had become a mainstream trend. One of the reasons for the broadcast was due to the exposure of a charity that made fake donations and pocketed the funds. With the live broadcast, they could also prove the authenticity of the charity auction.\nAlthough the cameras did not focus much on Lin Xiaowan, there were a few people who spoke about her. This was mostly due to her seat.\n[Hey, who\u2019s that girl sitting next to Gu Yuwu?]\n[That girl next to Gu Yuwu is so pretty. When the camera panned over to Sister Yuwu earlier, 1 saw her. Her skin is glowing!]\n[Perhaps she\u2019s a rookie. 1 saw Gu Yuwu talking to her earlier!]\n[Sister Gu isn\u2019t so free that she has time to look after a newbie like that. Their seats are near those famous celebrities. Perhaps she\u2019s a lesser-known celebrity from a small company?]\n[Can I just say that she\u2019s really pretty? Although she\u2019s not the stunning kind, the more I look at her, the more I like her!]\n[I agree! Although I\u2019m a girl, I like her look a lot. She looks kind, and her eyes are sparkling. She looks very gentle with no attack power at all. She\u2019s definitely very popular among girls!]\n[I want to know more about her! If she\u2019s a celebrity, I\u2019ll become her fan immediately!]\n[Even as a man, 1 like her very much!]\n[I still prefer a cool and valiant person like Sister Gu!]\n[I just looked through Sister Gu\u2019s social media, but there\u2019s no sign of this girl. The latest post is still that of Lin Qing.]\nThe discussions in the comment section moved very quickly. It did not take long before they began to discuss Lin Qing\u2019s latest videos and designs. When the camera turned to the stage for the performance, the topic also quickly turned to performance.\nWhen the topic returned to Lin Xiaowan again, it was when she was bidding for Wu Shenbo\u2019s Longevity painting.\n\nLin Xiaowan had forgotten about the live broadcast since no one talked about it. Moreover, the cameras were placed far away in discreet positions. She completely forgot that the cameras were filming everything.\nSince Lin Xiaowan was bidding, when the cameras turned to her, they did not sweep past her like before. This time, her face was clearly shown. Naturally, they also showed the young boy seated at the back who was also bidding.\nHowever, since this was an auction, the cameras focused more on the items that were put up for auction.\nJust like Lin Xiaowan, the audience also found the style of bidding strange.\n[I can tell that the little beauty is speechless. I\u2019m also speechless. What\u2019s the other party trying to do?]\n[It\u2019s been 8oo rounds! The time that passed is enough for Tang Sanzang to complete his pilgrimage to the West and deliver the Buddhist scripture. How long is this going to last?]\n[I\u2019m going to die of laughter! The little beauty raised the bid fiercely in the beginning, but now she has also fallen into the other party\u2019s rhythm\u2026] [Hahahahaha! When the camera zoomed in, I caught her rolling her eyes! It\u2019s obvious that she\u2019s annoyed!]\n[Hey, you see that person who starred in The Boys Next Door? Is that person next to him Qian Yiran who stole the limelight in that talent show? Who\u2019s that middle-aged man seated with them? Is he their father? 1 saw the three of them talking earlier!]\n[No way. Qian Yiran said on the show that her father is just an ordinary worker.]\n[I\u2019m a fan of hers, and 1 feel a little complicated right now. 1 suspect that the middle-aged man is Qian Yiran\u2019s backer.]\nThe screen was filled with many question marks about this comment.\n[What??? You can\u2019t speak without evidence. That\u2019s terrible behavior!]\n[Considering how she has been in the limelight recently, I feel like this might be possible\u2026]\n[Wow, I can watch a show just by watching this live broadcast! ]\n[Things are getting interesting. Who\u2019s that boy who blushed when he was bidding? Does anyone know him?]\n[I don\u2019t know who the red-faced boy is, but someone seems to have found who that little beauty next to Sister Gu is.]\n[Am 1 the only one here who\u2019s interested in the items that are being auctioned?]\n\n[I just went on Speaker, and I saw posts about that mysterious little beauty. Not only are you guys watching the live broadcast, but all of you even have time to become Sherlock Holmes?]\nSomeone had analyzed the photos of Lin Xiaowan from Lin Qing\u2019s video back then that only showed her slender neck and her collarbone. They compared it to the screenshots of her at the auction. They confidently concluded that they were the same person.\nSome people found this ridiculous and made it known in the comment section.\n[Just by looking at the neck and collarbone you came to this conclusion? I\u2019ll only believe it if Gu Yuwu confirms this herself!]\n[It\u2019s not impossible. After all, it\u2019s not difficult to identify a person by their chin or eyebrows. As such, it\u2019s not impossible to identify someone based on their necks and collarbones.]\n[Does this mean she\u2019s not a celebrity? She\u2019s sitting with Sister Gu because they\u2019re friends?]\n[She could also be related to Sister Gu. In the video, she called Sister Gu, \u2018Sister\u2019.]\n[Stop speculating blindly. Who cares who she is? Can\u2019t you just admire her beauty quietly?]\n[In any case, the two of them have something in common. Their skin is glowing. Based on that alone, 1 feel like there\u2019s a high possibility that they\u2019re related!]\nLin Xiaowan was unaware that she was in danger of being exposed. At that time, she was focused on the bidding. She raised her paddle, and when she lowered it, she met the gaze of a bidder sitting on the other side.\nThe other party smiled at her politely, and she returned the smile. She felt that the entertainment industry was really small.\nThe other party was the playboy in a flowery shirt whom she had met when she went out with Cheng Ruitong. Today, he was dressed decently in a suit, and his hair was also meticulously styled. He looked mature today.\nSomeone placed a bid at this moment. When Lin Xiaowan heard the 1,000 increase, the corners of her lips twitched. Contrary to her expectations, when she turned around, she discovered that the red-faced young boy from before was not the one doing the bidding. Instead, it was a dignified young girl sitting next to him.\nThe young boy was nowhere to be seen, and the seat next to him, which was occupied by the bald middle-aged man, was also empty. It was likely that he had left early.\nThe girl was none other than Qian Yiran, who was being discussed earlier. When she saw Lin Xiaowan looking at her, she straightened her back and smiled with a hint of pride.\nLin Xiaowan was baffled when she saw the other party\u2019s smug smile. She did not think too much of it and withdrew her gaze.\nIn the end, it was the rich young master who won the bid for the red wine.\nAfter the banquet ended, there was a small after-party. Lin Xiaowan was not interested in it. She would not be able to fill her stomach at such a party, and the people there also spoke with hidden meaning. Just thinking about it made her feel bored. After she went through the formalities, she asked Gu Yuwu if the latter was planning to stay back..\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

I\u2019ll go with you.\u201d\nThe live broadcast had already ended.\nLin Xiaowan had just taken a few steps when she saw the handsome young master standing nearby. When he saw her, he approached her.\nHe stood at an appropriate distance and said politely, \u201cMrs. Huo, it seems like you like the bottle of red wine a lot. 1 wonder if you\u2019ll accept it.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan looked horrified when she heard this. She recalled the rumors about him being ambiguous with members of the opposite sex, and she said, \u201cNo, I can\u2019t accept it. By the way, my surname is Lin, not Huo.\u201d\nThen, Lin Xiaowan grabbed Gu Yuwu\u2019s hand tightly before she asked, \u201cYou\u2026 Why are you giving it to me?\u201d\nShe was so nervous that even her long-lost accent from her hometown came out.\nHai Linzhi, the wealthy young master, said with a shrug, \u201cI just want to be friends with Miss Lin. Will you give me a chance, Miss Lin?\u201d\nUpon hearing this, Lin Xiaowan looked even more horrified.\n\u2018No way. He can\u2019t really like me, right? After all, he addressed me as Mrs. Huo earlier\u2026 He must know about my relationship with Huo Zheng\u2026\u2019\nGu Yuwu looked at Hai Linzhi as though she was looking at a fool. She said bluntly, \u201cAre you sick? Did you not take your medicine today? Should I punch you twice to cure you of your illness?\u201d\nSeeing the familiar way Gu Yuwu spoke to Hai Linzhi, Lin Xiaowan asked, \u201cDo you know each other?\u201d\nGu Yuwu replied, \u201cOur social circles overlapped after all. It\u2019s hard not to know each other\u2026\u201d\nSeeing how nervous Lin Xiaowan was, Gu Yuwu comforted her as she said, \u201cHis name is Hai Linzhi. He\u2019s the vice president of his family\u2019s company. Don\u2019t judge him by his frivolous words and actions. He\u2019s not a bad person.\u201d\n\nHai Linzhi smiled, looking more sincere. He asked, \u201cShall we get to know each other?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan hesitated for two seconds.\nAt this time, Gu Yuwu took the lead and replied, \u201cGet to know each other my as*! Don\u2019t lead her astray. Nothing good will come from being involved with you.\u201d\nHai Linzhi feigned an injured expression on his face as he said with a sigh, \u201cMy heart really hurts after being criticized by a beautiful woman.\u201d\nThe corners of Lin Xiaowan\u2019s lips twitched. In the end, she did not accept the bottle of wine. After completing the payment procedures, she still could not figure out Hai Linzhi\u2019s purpose in approaching her. She did not believe it was just to befriend her.\nAs though Gu Yuwu could read Lin Xiaowan\u2019s thoughts, she patted the wary Lin Xiaowan\u2019s hand and said, \u201cHai Linzhi probably wants to build a good relationship with you because of Huo Zheng. He doesn\u2019t have much say in his family. Recently, one of his projects was rejected. With his status, it\u2019s hard for him to build a connection with Huo Corporation. He\u2019s probably trying to go about it in a roundabout way.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan grew even more worried when she heard these words. She said, \u201cThen I have to stay away from him even more. What if he uses me, and it affects Huo Zheng?\u201d\nGu Yuwu said, \u201cHai Linzhi is a good person. Don\u2019t worry. He\u2019s also very capable. 1 know a little about his project. There are many advantages, but it\u2019s difficult to execute. Moreover, his family is quite conservative\u2026\u201d\nGu Yuwu had known Hai Linzhi for a long time so she was familiar with his character.\nLin Xiaowan nodded thoughtfully. She dispelled some of her concerns after listening to Gu Yuwu\u2019s words. Then, she considered mentioning this matter to Huo Zheng so that he could take note of it.\nAt this moment, Gu Yuwu thought of something, and she said, \u201cI just realized that he really chose the right time to approach you. I know him well enough.\nHe took advantage of the fact that I\u2019m with you and approached you. He knew that even if you were wary of him, I\u2019d definitely tell you about him and the purpose he approached you.\u201d\nThen, Gu Yuwu asked, \u201cAfter listening to me, did you consider telling Huo Zheng about this or ask Huo Zheng what he thinks about Hai Linzhi?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan nodded in confusion. \u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cLook, if you did that, even if Huo Zheng didn\u2019t know Hai Linzhi, he would learn of Hai Linzhi\u2019s name from you. Perhaps he might even ask someone to look up Hai Linzhi\u2019s project. If Huo Zheng thinks the project is not bad, then Hai Linzhi\u2019s chance will come\u2026\u201d Gu Yuwu said, looking slightly impressed, \u201cThat kid is not bad\u2026\u201d\nLin Xiaowan still looked a little confused as she asked, \u201cThen should 1 tell Huo Zheng about Hai Linzhi or not? Moreover, will the project you mention negatively affect Huo Zheng?\u201d\nGu Yuwu replied, \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019ll affect him. After all, your Huo Zheng is also a cunning old fox. He knows how to judge what\u2019s right or wrong. If you want to speak to him about it, then just do it. Just treat it as giving Hai Linzhi a chance. After all, Hai Linzhi is capable.\u201d\n\nLin Xiaowan nodded before she said with a sigh, \u201cHai Linzhi is really different from the rumors\u2026\u201d\nHai Linzhi\u2019s image had always been one of a carefree playboy who only knew how to eat, drink, and play.\nGu Yuwu, who knew a little of the inside story, said, \u201cHis family situation is a little complicated. He\u2019s probably hiding his edges and biding his time\u2026\u201d\nGu Yuwu smiled as she continued to say, \u201cDon\u2019t listen to the rumors about him being a playboy. 1 know the rumors said that he has a lot of girlfriends and that he\u2019s a playboy. That\u2019s just the surface of things. In private, he\u2019s actually quite traditional\u2026\u201d\nAfter Hai Linzhi, who was in a good mood, left, he handed the bottle of red wine to his subordinate, instructing his subordinate to send it to Huo Zheng along with a handwritten note.\nHe knew very well everything depended on whether he could seize this opportunity. If he succeeded, he would have the courage to go all out.\nWhen Lin Xiaowan returned, she told Huo Zheng everything and asked for his opinion.\n\u201cWill you look into his project?\u201d\n\u201cThat depends on his character and his project\u2026\u201d\nLin Xiaowan rested her chin on her hands, feeling unhappy that she had been used. She said with a sigh, \u201cIt seems like Sister Yuwu was right. It doesn\u2019t matter if you know him or not, at the very least, you know his name now after I told you about everything\u2026\u201d\nHuo Zheng pulled her into his arms and said, \u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal. If he\u2019s really capable and smart, I might give him a chance\u2026\u201d\n\u201cAlright.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan reached out to hold Huo Zheng\u2019s face and kissed him before she said, \u201cIn any case, it\u2019s fine as long as 1 don\u2019t cause you any trouble.\u201d\nIn Lin Xiaowan\u2019s opinion, Hai Linzhi should be a good person, and most importantly, he was smart. He knew when to retreat and when to advance. His jokes were just right, and his words did not hold any hidden meaning. Although he had his own plans, he was rather sincere as well.\nThe next day, Huo Zheng received a bottle of red wine, which was sent to the company. A hint of approval could be seen in his eyes after he read the accompanying note.\nSubsequently, he asked Assistant Song to investigate some matters.\nHai Linzhi\u2019s note read: I\u2019m very sorry for using Miss Lin to introduce myself to you, Second Master Huo. I hope that you\u2019ll convey my apologies to Miss Lin. This gift is just a small token of my apology. If there\u2019s a chance next time, I\u2019ll apologize in person.\nIndeed, Hai Linzhi was very smart.\nHuo Zheng was not a cold-blooded demon. He was willing to give such a person an opportunity to cooperate..\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

The invitation was exquisite. At that time, Hong Minhua even told her to not bring any gifts and that her presence was enough. Needless to say, it was impossible for her not to bring any gifts. No matter what, she had to express her gratitude. Moreover, she had already gotten the other party a gift. There was no reason for her not to give it to the other party.\nLin Xiaowan got up early in the morning. While she was deciding what to wear, she saw Huo Zheng getting ready for work. She asked, \u201cYou\u2019re going to work today?\u201d\nHuo Zheng buttoned his shirt. After he was done, he stood at the side, waiting for Lin Xiaowan to pick a tie for him. Upon hearing her question, he asked in return, \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I go to work today?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s Grandma Hong\u2019s birthday party today. Aren\u2019t you coming with me?\u201d Lin Xiaowan asked.\nHuo Zheng leaned over and kissed Lin Xiaowan while she put on his tie for him before he replied, \u201cThat\u2019s tonight, right?\u201d\nIn other words, he could get a lot of work done during the day.\nIn fact, Huo Zheng rarely attended events like this in the past. Usually, he would send someone to deliver the gift, and no one would say anything about it. However, the situation was different now. He was naturally willing to attend such an event because of Lin Xiaowan.\n\u201cOh, okay.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan selected a few pieces of clothing, but she was not too satisfied with them. She wanted to wear something that would match Huo Zheng. However, his clothes were all dark while hers were light.\nShe thought of something at this moment and asked, \u201cBy the way, what are you giving Grandma Hong?\u201d\nHuo Zheng was putting on his watch when he heard her question. He smiled and replied, \u201cI\u2019m giving her the painting, Auspicious Sun on Mount Lu.\u201d\nThis was what Lin Xiaowan planned to give Hong Minhua if she could not find anything better. Although it was not her first choice, its value could not be underestimated. In fact, it was even more valuable than Wu Shenbo\u2019s Longevity painting that she had bid for. Previously, Huo Zheng had told Assistant Song to obtain the painting for him.\n\nLin Xiaowan pinched him lightly when she heard his words. She said jokingly, \u201cHey! You benefited from my research!\u201d\nHuo Zheng chuckled. Before he left, he asked, \u201cShall we go together? 1\u201911 get the driver to pick you up later\u2026\u201d\nLin Xiaowan thought about it for a moment before she said, \u201cOkay, pick me up at the dessert shop.\u201d\nShe had not drawn any anthropomorphic desserts recently, and she wanted to practice more for the Venus Hope Competition. However, when she thought about how she would have to bring her dress and shoes to the dessert shop with her later to change before the party, she changed her mind. She said, \u201cForget it. Pick me up at home.\u201d\nAt night.\nWhen they arrived at the banquet hall, Lin Xiaowan handed the gift to the person standing at the entrance as per customs.\nUpon seeing this, the Hong family\u2019s butler did not put the gift away with the other gifts. He said with a smile, \u201cI\u2019ll personally bring Miss Lin\u2019s gift to Old Madam\u2019s room.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan, who addressed Hong Minhua as Grandma Hong, was not used to hearing the latter being addressed as Old Madam.\nThere were not many familiar faces at the birthday party, and Gu Yuwu was not in attendance. Previously, she had said to Lin Xiaowan, \u201cIt\u2019s so boring. If I go, I\u2019ll only have to make small talk. Moreover, I\u2019m not involved in my family\u2019s business. I\u2019m not going.\u201d\nToday, Hong Minhua was dressed in a bright and elegant red dress. It was a traditional Shangxia dress, and it was similar to what Mrs. Zheng, her daughter-in-law, liked to wear. It was obvious that Mrs. Zheng had helped her dress up today.\nSpeaking of Mrs. Zheng, Lin Xiaowan learned not long ago that the former had the same surname as her husband. Her husband\u2019s surname was also Zheng.\nNot long after, Hong Minhua gave a short speech before she happily went over to cut her cake. After that, it was time for everyone to socialize.\nAlthough Lin Xiaowan did not know anyone, everyone knew Huo Zheng. Alas, he had no intention of socializing today. Those who wanted to strike up a conversation with him were deterred by his cold expression. In just a while, no one dared to shamelessly approach him anymore.\nNonetheless, this did not stop others from talking about him. Seeing that Huo Zheng had no intention of socializing, two people stood in the distance and discussed among themselves.\n\u201cThat woman next to him is the boss of the dessert shop, right? 1 told you about her previously, but you didn\u2019t believe me!\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re right. However, 1 heard she hasn\u2019t been going to the shop recently\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that has anything to do with Second Master Huo. By the way, I heard that she has a high status in the Huo family\u2026\u201d\n\u201cDid they get married? I haven\u2019t heard any news about that though\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so. My wife ran into Mrs. Huo once. Mrs. Huo said that the young woman has no intention of getting married yet since she\u2019s still so young\u2026\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s surprising\u2026\u201d\nLin Xiaowan was eating a small slice of cake at this moment. Seeing how different Huo Zheng was from his usual gentleness, she said teasingly, \u201cYou were so fierce earlier.\u201d\nHuo Zheng\u2019s expression softened when he looked down at Lin Xiaowan and said, \u201cBut I\u2019ll never be fierce to you\u2026\u201d\nLin Xiaowan continued to enjoy the food at the banquet. The food was exquisite and delicious, thanks to Hong Minhua who was a foodie. There were many of them that she had never seen before.\nWhile the couple chatted softly among themselves, she suddenly felt a gaze on her. When she looked up, she saw Hai Linzhi standing not far away, smiling at her.\nHai Linzhi was dressed in a flashy casual suit with a peony pinned on his chest pocket. He looked rather frivolous.\nLin Xiaowan was speechless. She had met Hai Linzhi thrice, and each time, he was dressed in different styles. It was truly unpredictable.\nSeeing that Lin Xiaowan and Huo Zheng had noticed him, Hai Linzhi walked over. He raised the glass in his hand and said, \u201cMiss Lin, I\u2019m sorry about what happened at the auction previously.\u201d\nHai Linzhi\u2019s attitude was neither servile nor overbearing. His voice was gentle, and his expression was sincere, making it difficult hard for people to dislike him.\nAfter listening to Gu Yuwu\u2019s explanation and Huo Zheng\u2019s words, Lin Xiaowan was no longer wary of Hai Linzhi. However, she still scoffed and looked away.\nHuo Zheng smiled and squeezed her hand.\nHai Linzhi scratched his nose awkwardly.\nIn fact, after Gu Yuwu praised Hai Linzhi in a roundabout manner, Lin Xiaowan was not really angry with Hai Linzhi.\nHai Linzhi seemed to know this, and he continued to say, \u201cInitially, I wanted to apologize to Miss Lin after I left that day. However, I didn\u2019t have Miss Lin\u2019s contact information. As such, 1 could only wait for the right time to apologize..\u201d\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

She said, \u201cYou know Sister Gu, right? You could\u2019ve asked her for my contact information\u2026\u201d\nHan Lizhi coughed before he said awkwardly, \u201cI did, but she didn\u2019t want to give it to me. She was worried that\u2026 I\u2019d schemed against you again\u2026\u201d\nLin Xiaowan wanted to laugh when she saw the slightly embarrassed expression on Hai Linzhi\u2019s face. However, she forced herself to hold back her laughter and pursed her lips. After a long time, she said, \u201cSister Gu was right. 1 wouldn\u2019t have given you my contact information either. Who asked you to scheme against me?\u201d\n\u201cAlright. In any case, 1 came today to apologize,\u201d Hai Linzhi said. He did not force her to accept his apology. He continued to say, \u201cHowever, if 1 had to do it all over again, I would probably do the same thing\u2026\u201d\nSeeing Lin Xiaowan\u2019s widened eyes, Hai Linzhi said with a smile, \u201cAfter all, 1 have to fight for my own opportunities!\u201d\nLin Xiaowan looked at Huo Zheng, who had remained silent all this time, before she said seriously, \u201cIt seems like what you said is true. He\u2019s really smart.\u201d\nHai Linzhi was indeed slightly troubled earlier. In the end, he decided to be candid, hoping that it would dispel Lin Xiaowan\u2019s prejudice against him. He was very observant and good at seizing opportunities. When he heard Lin Xiaowan\u2019s words now, he also knew that the unhappiness in her heart had mostly dissipated. He seized the chance and asked, \u201cThen, Miss Lin, are you willing to give me your contact information now? I promise I don\u2019t have any other intentions.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan rolled her eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t believe you.\u201d\nSeeing this, Hai Linzhi also knew he had no chance. He said, \u201cAlright. Then I can only place my hopes on Second Master Huo.\u201d\nThen, he looked at Huo Zheng and said, \u201cI hope that my apology is satisfactory to you.\u201d\nHuo Zheng nodded.\nAfter the banquet ended, Huo Zheng and Lin Xiaowan stood at the entrance, waiting for their car. Coincidentally, they ran into Hai Linzhi again. Or perhaps, Hai Linzhi had been waiting for them all along.\n\nHowever, Hai Linzhi did not continue to pester Lin Xiaowan. He only gave her a small gift and said, \u201cThis is a small token of apology.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan looked at him suspiciously as she said, \u201cCan I open it now? If it\u2019s very expensive then I don\u2019t want it. In fact, I\u2019m not really angry. I\u2019ve heard about you\u2026\u201d\nHai Linzhi gestured to her, indicating that she should open the gift as he said, \u201cIt\u2019s just a small gift.\u201d\nWhen Lin Xiaowan opened the small box, she saw a small pendant inside of a popular cartoon character. It was very cute. It was not expensive, but it was not easy to buy it in the country.\nLin Xiaowan liked the gift a lot. She said, \u201cAlright, 1\u201911 accept your gift.\u201d\nFollowing that, Lin Xiaowan told Hai Linzhi to wait for a moment. She retrieved her phone from her bag. The dress she had worn did not have pockets after all. Then, she waved her phone at him and asked, \u201cDo you want to exchange numbers?\u201d\nAt this time, Huo Zheng narrowed his eyes and asked, \u201cMy dear, don\u2019t you think it\u2019s inappropriate for you to ask for another man\u2019s number in front of me?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan looked at him fearlessly. She pretended to think about it for a moment before she said, \u201cYou\u2019re right. Why don\u2019t you get into the car first and pretend not to know anything?\u201d\nNaturally, Huo Zheng was only joking with her. When he heard her response, he could only smile helplessly. He could only spoil his girlfriend.\nNo one expected that their interaction at the entrance would be captured by the paparazzi. It did not take long before photos were posted on the Internet. The photos\u2019 caption read: Playboy Spotted Behaving Intimately With a Mysterious Woman!\nHai Linzhi almost spat out blood when he was notified about this matter by his public relation team. The first thing he did was clicked on the contact he had just added not long ago and sent a message along with a row of an emoji that showed someone kneeling on the ground.\n[Hai Linzhi: I\u2019m sorry, Miss Lin. Please tell Second Master Huo not to give up on me!]\nAt the same time, he wondered inwardly, \u2018When the media take photos like this, don\u2019t they usually approach the party involved to ask for money first?! Don\u2019t they only release the photos when they can\u2019t get any money? Which amateur paparazzi did this?!\u2019\nPreviously, Hai Linzhi did not care about the rumors about him. He did not bother paying the media off when his photos were taken. After all, he wanted to establish his image as a playboy to confuse his enemies. However, this time, he felt like he had shot himself in the foot.\nNeedless to say, Hai Linzhi was furious.\n\nLin Xiaowan did not check Speaker regularly so she was unaware of the latest gossip. When she received Hai Linzhi\u2019s message, she was puzzled and asked Huo Zheng about it.\n\u201cWhat does Hai Linzhi mean by this? Why is suddenly apologizing to me?\u201d\nHuo Zheng was puzzled as well.\n[Lin Xiaowan: Did something happen? Why are you suddenly apologizing to me?]\nAt the same time, Hai Linzhi was being scolded by Gu Yuwu over the phone.\nGu Yuwu was in the entertainment industry after all. She naturally had a team of people who monitored the news. Moreover, the people around her knew about her relationship with Lin Xiaowan. As such, she was quickly informed about the news.\nAs soon as she learned about this, she rolled up her sleeves and commented on the photos, ridiculing the photos and the news\u2019 authenticity, before she called Hai Linzhi.\nHai Linzhi did not dare to defend himself and could only say bitterly, \u201cI\u2019m really sorry. The photos were taken at the entrance of the banquet hall. 1 didn\u2019t expect them to make headlines\u2026\u201d\nThe only thing Hai Linzhi was thankful for was that the photos were not trending a lot.\nMeanwhile, Lin Xiaowan quickly went on Speaker and looked at the real-time entertainment news. She felt that something was amiss.\nHuo Zheng was next to her so he quickly saw the photos taken by the paparazzi.\nLin Xiaowan was speechless when she saw the photos. However, when she recovered, she completely missed the main point. She zoomed in on the blurry photos as she said, \u201cWhat do you think? Although the photos look blurry, 1 think 1 look quite good.\u201d\nHuo Zheng did not respond. He was looking at the nine photos seriously.\nLin Xiaowan did not take this matter seriously at all. After all, there were many rumors about Hai Linzhi in the past, and she had seen a few of them. She was not upset and only found it a little funny. However, seeing that Huo Zheng\u2019s expression was not too good, she assumed that he was upset. After thinking about it, she thought that it made sense. After all, his girlfriend was being linked to another man on the news.\nLin Xiaowan put her phone down and decided to coax Huo Zheng first. \u201cDon\u2019t be upset. Based on Hai Linzhi\u2019s reaction, it\u2019s likely that he didn\u2019t expect this as well. I\u2019ll ask him to clarify this matter later. I have an account on Speaker so I\u2019ll clarify this matter as well.\u201d\nThen, Lin Xiaowan feigned anger as she scolded, \u201cThose people are really blind! How were we behaving intimately? Nonsense!\u201d\nIn fact, Huo Zheng was upset because of a wholly different reason.. He was also present at the time the photos were taken, but why was it that only a little of his shoulder could be seen in the nine photos? Who taught the paparazzi to take photos like that?\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

However, when he was signed in, he almost fainted. The popularity of this topic had shot up to third place.\nGu Yuwu was not the only one who had gotten involved. Even Huo Corporation\u2019s official account had commented on the photos.\n[Huo Corporation: Why is that only a little of our President Huo\u2019s shoulder could be seen in the photos? Young Master Huo, don\u2019t you think this is a little unfair?]\n[Hai Linzhi: This has nothing to do with me! 1\u201911 come and apologize in person later! ]\nHai Linzhi really felt like throwing up blood at this moment. Why was he always apologizing? It was the paparazzi\u2019s fault!\nHe could not help but feel slightly anxious. After all, the Huo Corporation\u2019s account usually only posted serious and business-related matters. This comment was a deviation from the account\u2019s usual post so Hai Linzhi knew that Huo Zheng must have something to do with it.\n\u2018Damn it! If he thinks that I have a hand in this, it\u2019ll be over for me!*\nWith this thought in mind, Hai Linzhi typed furiously on his phone.\n[Hai Linzhi: I was shocked and speechless when 1 saw these photos. Obviously, apart from me and Miss Lin, Miss Lin\u2019s boyfriend, Mr. Huo, was also present at the time the photos were taken. We were at the entrance of the hotel because we coincidentally attended the same banquet. Previously, I had a little personal conflict with Miss Lin so I approached her to give a small token of apology. Mr. Huo Zheng was present the entire time we interacted.]\nAfter posting that, Hai Linzhi looked at the cursed headlines again. Feeling dissatisfied, he posted again.\n[Hai Linzhi: We were NOT behaving intimately! We\u2019ve only met twice before this! The media should stop making up stories!]\n\nLin Xiaowan refreshed the page and saw all the clarification posts. In the end, she decided not to get involved since the matter had been resolved. She was more concerned about Huo Zheng\u2019s feelings. However, she had to admit that his reaction was really cute.\nShe put her phone away and looked at Huo Zheng. She looked like the cat that got the cream as she asked knowingly, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\nHuo Zheng pretended not to understand and only said, \u201cIt\u2019s time for bed.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan chuckled. As she was thinking of ways to continue teasing Huo Zheng, she received another message from Hai Linzhi.\n[Hai Linzhi: Miss Lin, I really had nothing to do with this matter. Please don\u2019t be prejudiced against me because of this matter.]\nLin Xiaowan laughed as she showed the message to Huo Zheng and asked, \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d\nHuo Zheng took the phone and placed it on the table as he said, \u201cWork is work.\u201d\nIn short, he knew the matter had nothing to do with Hai Linzhi, and he would not confuse work matters with personal matters.\nLin Xiaowan looked at her phone that had been taken away before she snuggled under the blanket. Then, she asked, \u201cShouldn\u2019t we reply to the message? Otherwise, I don\u2019t think he\u2019d be able to sleep tonight.\u201d\nHuo Zheng sneered. Obviously holding a grudge, he said, \u201cWith this serving as a reminder, he\u2019ll be more careful in the future.\u201d\nAt the same time, this piece of news was gaining more and more traction. After all, many people were browsing the Internet at this time. The time was just right; everyone was browsing on their phones before going to bed. Naturally, there were many people who were watching the show.\n[Netizen #1: Wait, wait, wait. This matter is progressing too quickly! Hahaha!

It seems like all wealthy people run in the same circle! ]\n[Netizen #14: Can we please discuss the lady boss\u2019 beauty? I really like the way she looks. She has big eyes, and her face is slightly chubby. She looks a little like an arrogant ragdoll cat.]\n[Netizen #15:1 agree! The more I look at the photos, the more 1 feel she\u2019s beautiful.]\n[Netizen #16: Someone found her account on Speaker. Go and have a look!]\nLin Xiaowan was woken up by her phone ringing the next morning.\nHuo Zheng had already left for work at this time.\nShe got up and looked for her phone. She was puzzled when she saw it was Gu Yuwu. She could not figure out why Gu Yuwu was calling her so early in the morning.\n\u201cHello, Sister Yuwu, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d\nUpon hearing Lin Xiaowan\u2019s soft and nasally voice, Gu Yuwu knew that Lin Xiaowan was not fully awake yet. She said, feeling slightly guilty, \u201cI have something to tell you.\u201d\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\n\u201cYou know how we followed each other on Speaker?\u201d Gu Yuwu said, slightly embarrassed, \u201cI commented on the photos yesterday, and some people made the connection from my previous posts. They\u2019ve found your account as well.\u201d Lin Xiaowan was still slightly groggy, unable to fully comprehend Gu Yuwu\u2019s words. \u201cWhat do you mean? How was my account discovered?\u201d\n\u201cThe paparazzi took photos of you and Hai Linzhi, right? Someone made the connection that you were the one sitting next to me during the auction after comparing photos and that you\u2019re Huo Zheng\u2019s girlfriend. They found your account through my account\u2026\u201d\nLin Xiaowan felt speechless when she heard these words..\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

Was 1 filmed during the auction?\u201d Lin Xiaowan asked skeptically, \u201cI thought the cameras were only focused on the celebrities\u2026\u201d\nHmm\u2026\u201d\nLin Xiaowan was a little worried. She asked, \u201cThen will people come to my page and scold me?\u201d\nGu Yuwu did not know whether to laugh or cry upon hearing this. \u201cWhat are you thinking? You have no idea how many people like you! Even if there are people who don\u2019t like you, sowhat? You\u2019re not money, it\u2019s impossible for everyone to like you. No, in fact, there are also people who dislike money!\u201d\nGu Yuwu laughed before she continued to say, \u201cHowever, due to discovery, even more people know that you\u2019re the boss of the dessert shop. 1 think that your dessert shop is about to experience another wave of popularity!\u201d\nLin Xiaowan naturally did not mind this. She said, \u201cSister Zhu will be happy then. With this, she\u2019ll be able to save some money from advertising\u2026\u201d\nThe dessert shop\u2019s dividends were paid seasonally. It had only been a month since autumn began, and Lin Xiaowan had just received her first pay. However, she had to pay a high amount for taxes. It was her first time paying taxes, and she felt distressed by the sum of money she had to part with.\nAfter ending the call with Gu Yuwu, Lin Xiaowan logged into her Speaker account, feeling both excited and nervous. However, in just a moment, her phone froze. She had gained too many followers and received too many messages. In just a night, she gained more than 100,000 followers.\n\u201cOh my gosh!\u201d\nLin Xiaowan searched yesterday\u2019s hot topic again to see how things developed. Only then did she discover how lively it had been last night after she went to bed.\nWhen she returned to her page again, she saw that there were thousands of comments under the poll that she had reposted from the Venus Hope Competition account. She did not dare to reply to any of the comments. If she had known so many people would see it, she would not have made such a ridiculous wish like watching a meteor shower on the moon. It would have been less embarrassing if she had said she wanted to become rich overnight.\n\nSeeing the comments that were laughing at her, she could only pretend like she did not see them.\nLater in the day, Lin Xiaowan received a message from a member of the Animal Rescue Association. The other party also included a short video.\n[Staff member: Miss Lin, the video has been posted. Don\u2019t worry. We made sure to protect your privacy. 1\nLin Xiaowan logged into Bobo Star to look at the video. Apart from the scenes of her and Huo Zheng visiting Little Chestnut, there were also scenes of other owners adopting the shelter\u2019s cats and dogs. It also showed the daily lives of the pets in the shelter and the pet getting vaccinated.\nLin Xiaowan\u2019s account on Bobo Star was still anonymous; it was still a safe zone. She only had a few followers due to Little Chestnut.\nAfter waiting a few days, the custom-made scratching post finally arrived. It came with a small bed that was in the shape of a cat\u2019s paw. It was soft and cute.\nAfter the scratching post was assembled, Lin Xiaowan visited the Animal Rescue Association. Before bringing the kitten home, she bought some necessities first. She bought a litter box, more scratching posts, toys, water and food dispensers, and so on. She also bought a lor of cat food and treats. In short, everything was ready, and she was just waiting to bring the kitten home.\nThe day when Lin Xiaowan picked the kitten up, the staff member also gave her a vaccination booklet and explained to Lin Xiaowan that the kitten should be vaccinated every year.\nLin Xiaowan bought two kinds of litter boxes, an open and closed one. The kitten seemed to prefer the open one.\nLin Xiaowan crouched down and watched the kitten in the litter box, laughing. \u201cThis is a little cute.\u201d\nThe staff member took a picture of Lin Xiaowan shoveling the cat litter for the first time.\nLittle Chestnut had met Lin Xiaowan many times so it was already familiar with her. As such, it would not be particularly nervous although its living environment would change soon.\nLin Xiaowan fed it some cat treats and played with it for a while before she prepared to leave.\nBefore leaving, the staff member used dragon fruit juice on Little Chestnut\u2019s paw and stamped its paw on the adoption agreement. After that, Little Chesnut tried to lick its own paw, but Lin Xiaowan quickly wiped Little Chestnut\u2019s paw clean.\n\n\u201cWe ll post the video tonight. You can watch it then,\u201d rhe staff member said.\nThis staff member liked Little Chestnut a lot. She had been playing with it since it came to the shelter. She kept praising its unique appearance and how cute it was; she seemed even more excited than Lin Xiaowan.\nApart from that, Lin Xiaowan was also informed that Little Chestnut was a long-haired cat. It was about four months old, and when it reached puberty, its hair would start growing. However, there was also a possibility that its hair would grow a little later. She was also reminded to comb Little Chestnut\u2019s hair after it started growing.\nLin Xiaowan nodded as she listened to the other party\u2019s advice.\nAt night, the Animal Rescue Association posted the video they had taken during the day and tagged Lin Xiaowan\u2019s account on Bobo Star.\nLin Xiaowan did not comment on the previous video, but this time, she commented on this video.\n[I\u2019m Xiaowan: I\u2019ll treat Little Chestnut well!]\nWhen she logged in again before going to bed, she discovered that she had received many likes and replies. Many people asked if she could post more videos of Little Chestnut in the future and said that they would be Little Chestnut\u2019s aunts and uncles.\nLin Xiaowan was a little troubled by this. She did not have much experience taking videos, but it should be fine to take photos. She replied very truthfully.\n[I\u2019m Lin Xiaowan: I\u2019m sorry. I don\u2019t have much experience taking videos, and 1 don\u2019t know how to edit them. I\u2019m not sure that it\u2019ll work. ]\nWith Lin Xiaowan\u2019s reply, the comment section became livelier. Everyone said that it was okay and that they only wanted to see the cat.\nIn the end, Lin Xiaowan decided to only film the cat and did not appear in the videos. She thought about it and filmed a short video of Little Chestnut the next morning before uploading it to Bobo Star.\nIn the video, Little Chestnut was seen running and sniffing around. When it got tired, it drank a few mouthfuls of water. It also showed the nanny teasing it with a toy. There was also a scene showing it lying with its belly up on a desk, basking in the sun.\nLin Xiaowan spent a lot of effort on rhe video and even added music to it. When she watched the finished product, she was inspired and thought of a caption: Little Chestnut Is Patrolling Its Territory..\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

However, it was later reposted by the Animal Rescue Association. Who knew if it triggered some magical mechanism, but the number of views suddenly increased.\n[Netizen #1: Ah, Little Chestnut!]\n[Netizen #2: You seem to be adapting to your new home well.

Little Chestnut doesn\u2019t resemble its mother at all!]\n[Netizen #9: Even the color of Little Chestnut\u2019s eyes is different. The mother cat has big green eyes, but Little Chestnut\u2019s eyes are dark blue, 1 think?]\nWhen Lin Xiaowan saw the comments, she picked up Little Chestnut and studied it for a long time. Little Chestnut\u2019s eyes were big as well. However, rather than calling them dark blue, they were more black with flecks of blue.\nAfter posting that video, Lin Xiaowan felt like her mission was over. She did not care about anything else after that and began her blissful daily life of painting and playing with Little Chestnut.\nHuo Zheng soon realized that his status in Lin Xiaowan\u2019s heart seemed to have dropped. Her attention was completely taken away by Little Chestnut. This was especially true when Little Chestnut grew older, and its fur began to grow. Lin Xiaowan would hold the kitten and comb its fur very often. A loving smile could be seen on her face as she made plans for what to feed it every day.\n\nIn the past, when Huo Zheng returned from work, Lin Xiaowan would run over and hug him. However, now, when he entered the house, only the nanny would greet him and help bring him his slippers. As for Lin Xiaowan, if he did not look for her, she would not take the initiative to come to him. Even when they were eating, she would play with Little Chestnut. It was as though he had become invisible.\nOne day, after Huo Zheng got off work, Aunt Wu opened the door for him and handed him a cup of honey pomelo tea.\n\u201cIt\u2019s getting colder and colder. Autumn and winter are the times when it\u2019s easiest to catch a cold\u2026\u201d\nHuo Zheng drank two sips before he asked, \u201cIs Qingqing playing with the cat?\u201d\nAunt Wu smiled. \u201cShe\u2019s painting. She said she wants to paint the cat.\u201d\nHuo Zheng paused, feeling a small hint of dissatisfaction.\nSince Lin Xiaowan began to learn painting, she had only painted a portrait of him once. He had carefully framed it and displayed it at the old residence. However, the cat had only entered their lives a while ago, but she was already painting it. In the future, would the kitten\u2019s status surpass his?\nHuo Zheng thought about this matter as he went upstairs to change.\nA small gate was installed at the staircase to prevent Little Chestnut from running to the second floor now that it had grown older. Lin Xiaowan even decorated the gate, and it was rather cute.\nBased on Little Chestnut\u2019s age, it was possible for it to run around. However, it seemed to be aware that, and its range of movements had always been limited to the first floor. She did not try to go upstairs at all.\nInitially, Little Chestnut still looked a little ugly. However, after two months, its fur had grown very thick and shiny, and its color had darkened a lot. Its size also grew rapidly, and it was not a big cat.\nLin Xiaowan loved Little Chestnut so much that she wished she could cuddle it every day. Perhaps the kitten was used to her, it was especially coquettish with her. It was not aloof and would meow whenever it could not see humans. Even when it played, it would play where it could see people.\nAt this time, it was not even six months old. Thinking about this, Lin Xiaowan drew a little girl wearing a straw hat and playing in the garden. She kept Little Chestnut\u2019s black-and-blue eyes, grayish-black pointed ears, and furry tail. The style of the painting was similar to the lion painting she painted of Huo Zheng.\nWhen Huo Zheng looked at Lin Xiaowan\u2019s unfinished painting of Little Chestnut, he felt quite unhappy.\nMeanwhile, Lin Xiaowan heard a sound and turned around. Seeing that Huo Zheng had returned, she put down her brush and pulled him over.\n\u201cLook! I\u2019m painting Little Chestnut!\u201d\n\nLittle Chestnut was entertaining itself at the side, chasing its own tail.\n\u201cHmm,\u201d Huo Zheng replied. He glanced at Little Chestnut before he told Lin Xiaowan to wash her hands and get ready to eat. If it were up to him, she would not pick up the brush again tonight.\nAt this time, Lin Xiaowan\u2019s phone rang, reminding her to go to the Venus Hope Competition\u2019s official website to download and print the registration form. When she went to the official website, she saw that the registration would open three days later, which happened to be Monday.\nJust as she was about to put her phone away, she remembered that video she posted on Bobo Star a while ago. When she took a look, she was shocked by the number of views. Previously, it only had a few thousand views, but today alone there were more than 100,000 views. It seemed like Bobo Star had inexplicably promoted her video.\nLin Xiaowan showed her phone to Huo Zheng as she exclaimed, \u201cWow! Look!\nSo many people viewed Little Chestnut\u2019s video!\u201d\nApart from the views, Lin Xiaowan also gained more than 200 followers. There were also many comments.\nShe looked through the comments. Most of them praised how cute Little Chestnut was, and there were some who said that Little Chestnut was ugly but cute. Many people also asked why there were no more videos and updates of Little Chestnut, expressing their wish to see Little Chestnut.\n\u201cEveryone wants to see Little Chestnut! I\u2019ll take a video tomorrow! Hmm, but what kind of video should I take of her?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan returned to the main page of Bobo Star and began to look up videos of pets for inspiration.\nFrom the beginning until now, Huo Zheng was ignored by Lin Xiaowan. He could no longer endure it and reached out to cover her phone as he asked in a deep voice, \u201cI\u2019m sitting next to you. Why are you ignoring me?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan did not notice anything and replied, \u201cI didn\u2019t ignore you. Didn\u2019t I just tell you about Little Chestnut\u2019s fans?\u201d\n\u2018How can it be like that?\u2019\nHuo Zheng took her phone away from her.\nLin Xiaowan watched him place her phone on the bedside table before she asked, \u201cAre we going to sleep now? Aren\u2019t we going to read a book first?\u201d\nPreviously, Huo Zheng and her would read a book together before bed to improve her oral communication skills.\nHuo Zheng turned the light off before he said in a low voice, \u201cNo, we\u2019re not sleeping yet.\u201d\nRealization dawned on Lin Xiaowan in the next second when Huo Zheng leaned over and kissed her..\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

Initially, she wanted to change it to \u2018Little Chestnut\u2019, but that username had been taken. After that, she also changed the profile picture. After that, she prepared to take a video of Little Chestnut. She planned to film Little Chestnut eating.\nLin Xiaowan\u2019s original plan was to let Little Chestnut sit in front of its small bow while she introduced Little Chestnut\u2019s food. After that, she would place the food in the bowl and let Little Chestnut eat. She planned to end the video with a shot of the empty bowl.\nAfter Lin Xiaowan brought different kinds of cat food out, she sat cross-legged after positioning her phone. Then, she asked Aunt Wu, who was looking at something on her phone, \u201cWill my face be captured like this?\u201d\nAunt Wu, who was sitting on a small stool, made an \u2018okay\u2019 gesture as she replied, \u201cNo. It\u2019ll be fine even if you move around a little\u2026\u201d\nLin Xiaowan asked Aunt Wu to click the button to start recording before she patted the cushion next to her and called out affectionately, \u201cLittle Chestnut, come and eat!\u201d\nMost people\u2019s voices would change when they speak to their pets, and Lin Xiaowan was not an exception.\nLittle Chestnut walked over and rubbed itself against Lin Xiaowan. It meowed a few times and let Lin Xiaowan pat it before it sat down elegantly. It even licked its paws and looked at Lin Xiaowan after sitting down.\nAlthough Lin Xiaowan\u2019s face was hidden, this was the first time she was taking a video of herself. For this reason, she was a little stiff.\n\u201cAlright, let\u2019s start.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan first took out a small piece of cooked chicken breast meat and waved them at the camera before she tore it into small strips.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll start with the chicken meat first. Little Chestnut likes it a lot.\u201d\nThen, what happened subsequently was out of Lin Xiaowan\u2019s expectations. Little Chestnut did not wait and immediately ate the chicken as soon as she placed it in its bowl.\nIn fact, this was only normal. After all, Lin Xiaowan did not specially train Little Chestnut. Usually, it would eat when the food dispenser dispensed food or when it was called to eat after the food was prepared. Occasionally, she would also hold the treats in her hand and feed them to Little Chestnut as she played with it. In short, there was no such thing as waiting before eating.\n\nLin Xiaowan was taken aback by the unexpected turn and could not decide if she should put the remaining strips of chicken meat into the bowl or not. However, after Little Chestnut emptied the bowl, it took the initiative to raise its head and eat the strips of chicken meat in her hand.\nAunt Wu laughed out loud. \u201cWe forgot that Little Chesnut is not used to waiting when it eats\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s fine,\u201d Lin Xiaowan said with a shrug. In any case, the result was the same. Whether Little Chestnut waited or not, the food would still be eaten in the end.\nAfter Little Chestnut was done with the chicken breast, Lin Xiaowan held a few small cubes of freeze-dried egg yolk and let Little Chestnut eat them off her hand. Subsequently, she opened a can of venison and vegetables.\nThe entire process showed Lin Xiaowan placing food in Little Chestnut\u2019s bowl, and Little Chestnut eating from the bowl.\nAfter a short while, Lin Xiaowan said, \u201cAlright. Shall we have some goat\u2019s milk today as well?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan rose to her feet to prepare the goat\u2019s milk. However, Little Chestnut, who was eating, suddenly looked up and meowed loudly in protest. \u201cHmm, is Little Chestnut unhappy? Don\u2019t you want to drink goat\u2019s milk? It was just delivered this morning. It\u2019s very fresh!\u201d\nAunt Wu thought about it for a moment before she said, \u201cShould we give it camel\u2019s milk? She\u2019s been drinking camel\u2019s milk recently. However, yesterday, when I gave her goat\u2019s milk in the morning, it took a long time before she finally drank it. She doesn\u2019t seem to like it\u2026\u201d\nThe camel milk was sent by Gu Yuwu and was specially formulated for cats. Someone recommended it to her, and she sent it over as a gift to Little Chestnut.\nWho knew if Little Chestnut understood their words or not? However, it meowed a few times after Aunt Wu finished speaking before it buried its face in the bowl again.\nNow that Little Chestnut had grown up, it began to eat slowly. Unlike when it just arrived, it would gobble up its food quickly as though it would starve to death if it ate any slower.\n\u201cHmm? Does she understand us?\u201d Lin Xiaowan was surprised.\nAunt Wu also found it strange. She stood up and said, \u201c1\u201911 prepare the milk.\u201d\nWhile Aunt Wu prepared the milk, Little Chestnut was almost finished with the food in the bowl. When it was done, it sat down and meowed at Lin Xiaowan.\nAfter the camel\u2019s milk was served, Little Chestnut lapped it up.\nWhen Little Chestnut was done, Lin Xiaowan grabbed a wet wipe and said, \u201cWe\u2019ll have to wipe your mouth after you\u2019re done.\u201d\n\nLittle Chestnut sat there without moving while Lin Xiaowan wiped its mouth. This was something especially magical since no one taught Little Chestnut. Previously, she would wipe its face and mouth after it finished its meal. As time went out, it would sit quietly after it was done with its meal.\nIt was also at this point that Lin Xiaowan ended the video. She took a look. Although it was a little slow and dragging, there was no other problem. She quickly cut out some useless scenes and sped up the video with an editing app before she posted the video. Her caption was also very simple: My Breakfast.\nLin Xiaowan had already decided that this account would be Little Chestnut\u2019s account that followed its daily life.\nThe number of views increased very slowly.\nLin Xiaowan waited expectantly for a while. After quite a few minutes, there were no likes or comments. She thought that it was normal and no longer paid attention to it, tossing her phone to her side.\nWhen Lin Xiaowan woke up from her afternoon nap, she logged into Bobo Star again. There were not many views, but there were a few comments.\n[Netizen #1: Ah, it\u2019s Little Chestnut! It\u2019s grown so big! It\u2019s much fluffier than before, and it looks better than before!]\nLin Xiaowan was about to reply when she recalled that the account belonged to Little Chestnut. For this reason, she replied to the comment as though she was Little Chestnut.\nAfter she was done, she went downstairs to look for the cat. As soon as she went downstairs, she saw shards of a broken porcelain vase, and Aunt Wu was sweeping them up.\nWhen Aunt Wu saw Lin Xiaowan\u2019s bare feet, she quickly said, \u201cWait! I\u2019ll use the vacuum cleaner after this to make sure there aren\u2019t shards left on the floor.\u201d \u201cWhat happened?\u201d Lin Xiaowan asked, puzzled.\nMeanwhile, Little Chestnut ran over to Lin Xiaowan as soon as it saw her. It meowed over and over again, sounding a little aggrieved.\nAunt Wu sighed. \u201cShe jumped onto the display cabinet and accidentally broke the vase. She seemed to be shocked and frightened by the loud noise\u2026\u201d\nLin Xiaowan did not know whether to laugh or cry when she heard this. She crouched down and comforted Little Chestnut.\nThis matter was quickly thrown to the back of Lin Xiaowan\u2019s mind. She cuddled Little Chestnut on the couch as she read the comments people left under the new video. After reading a comment, she asked Little Chestnut, \u201cDo you have anything to say about this?\u201d\nImmediately after, she asked, \u201cOh, is that what you want to say?\u201d\nIn the beginning, Little Chestnut would meow in response as though it understood Lin Xiaowan. However, after a short while, it grew bored and ran to the side to play with the cat teaser toy that was stuck to the floor-to-ceiling window, ignoring Lin Xiaowan.\nMeanwhile, Lin Xiaowan continued to pretend to be Little Chestnut and replied to the comments tirelessly..\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

She had been quite busy recently. After all, she would be participating in a painting competition. She had been practicing diligently.\nOn Monday, when the poll ended, Lin Xiaowan downloaded the registration form, filled it out, and submitted it.\nApart from giving her a few tips, Hong Minhua did not interfere with her work. After all, this was not a formal competition. There was no need for her to interfere too much.\nAlthough the number of views was not as high as that of the first video, it still had about 10,000 to 20,000 views. There were also dozens of comments.\nLin Xiaowan decided to record another video of Little Chestnut eating. As she fed Little Chestnut, she also directly responded to some of the comments from the previous video.\nAs she fed Little Chestnut a small piece of steamed pumpkin, she said, \u201cLittle Chestnut doesn\u2019t usually eat a lot, and she\u2019d stop once she was full.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about going hungry. I also have an automatic food dispenser for her that\u2019ll dispense food for her at set times,\u201d Lin Xiaowan said as she fed Little Chestnut small pieces of cooked shrimp and beef.\nAs she was feeding Little Chestnut vegetables, she said, \u201cHmm, Little Chestnut is just an ordinary kitten with long fur. I don\u2019t think she\u2019s of a particular breed\u2026\u201d\nWhen she was done, she showed her empty hands and the empty bowl as she said, \u201cAlright, mealtime is over!\u201d\nAfter Aunt Wu stopped the recording, she said worriedly, \u201cLittle Chestnut broke another set of crystal glasses today. My heart ached when I saw it. The glass set was really beautiful, but now, it\u2019s gone\u2026\u201d\nLittle Chestnut meowed a few times at the side. Although it could not understand, it looked as though it was trying to defend itself. Its expression also looked a little serious as it meowed.\nLin Xiaowan stroked Little Chestnut as she said, \u201cIt\u2019s fine, it\u2019s fine. We\u2019ll just remove those fragile things or move them to another place. It\u2019s still so young\u2026\u201d\nBack then, the designer had decorated the house. There were all kinds of decorations in the house, and some of them were placed in tricky places. It was inevitable that Little Chestnut, who liked running around, would knock a few things over. Moreover, it was not like Little Chestnut deliberately knocked those things over. It could not be blamed for knocking things over.\n\nAunt Wu naturally did not have any opinion about this matter. She had only casually said those words. After all, she was not the owner of the house and was just working here. If the owner was fine with it, then that was all there was to it.\nThe number of views for the videos was not high as well, but it would still attract people once in a while. Quite a few people were amused by Lin Xiaowan\u2019s reply.\n[Netizen #1:1 just read the replies. It seems like it\u2019s in the tone of Little Chestnut!]\n[Netizen #2: This is Little Chestnut\u2019s account after all. Little Chestnut is really beautiful now. Her fur is a little curly. She looks like a little delicate princess. 1 love it!]\n[Netizen #3: She\u2019s so smart! What kind of peerless princess is this?]\n[Netizen #4: This is the first time I\u2019ve seen a cat burping!]\n[Netizen #5: Little Chestnut is so cute. I want to kiss her to death!]\n[Netizen #6: Her sitting posture is really elegant, and she eats so slowly and gracefully! *kiss emoji*]\n[Netizen #7: Hahaha! Who would\u2019ve thought that such a beautiful princess used to be the ugliest in the litter?]\n[Netizen #8: Nonsense! Little Chestnut was not ugly when she was young! She looked unique!]\n[Netizen #9: She only looked ugly because her fur was messy. I\u2019ve never seen a cat with such messy and unruly fur. Thanks to Little Chestnut\u2019s mother, Little Chesnut\u2019s fur grew so beautifully. In any case, Little Chestnut is really cute. She\u2019s like the ugly duckling that turned into a swan! ]\n[Netizen #10: What\u2019s this? A new kitten? It\u2019s so cute! 1 want to kiss it!]\nWhen Lin Xiaowan logged in again, Little Chestnut already had about 980 followers. If she worked a little harder, it would not be long before Little Chestnut had a thousand followers.\nLin Xiaowan read the comments and found that a few of them were quite amusing. Regardless of whether Little Chestnut could understand or not, she would carry it and read a few cute comments to it.\nAfter posting another two videos, Lin Xiaowan began to feel tired. Although it was not difficult, she found it troublesome.\nOn this day, she was playing with her phone when she accidentally clicked on a live broadcast. With this, an idea suddenly came to her, and she wondered if she should let Little Chestnut do live broadcasts on its own. She thought the idea was feasible. In any case, this was Little Chestnut\u2019s account, and she was only helping it to post videos for this.\n\nIn the end, Lin Xiaowan bought a mini camera that Little Chestnut could wear around its neck. After checking the rules for live broadcasts on Bobo Star and verifying her account, she connected the Bluetooth camera.\nThis was Lin Xiaowan\u2019s first time doing so she was not very sure. She asked Aunt Wu to watch the live broadcast.\n\u201cAunt Wu, can you see the live broadcast on your phone?\u201d\n\u201cYes, yes, I can see it clearly.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan named the live broadcast, \u2018A Day in the Life of Little Chestnut\u2019.\nLin Xiaowan looked at the number of viewers. There were currently three viewers, and there was no comment at the moment. Then, she placed her phone that was connected to the camera on the table and left to do her own things.\nThe live broadcast showed Little Chestnut\u2019s point of view.\nAfter reading the rules of the live broadcast on Bobo Star, Lin Xiaowan knew that whether anyone watched the live broadcast or not, as long as it lasted a certain amount of time, she would receive a small amount of money from Bobo Star as a form of encouragement.\nLin Xiaowan naturally did not care about money. She was not doing this to make a living after all.\nLin Xiaowan was painting in the studio when she heard a faint knocking sound. She looked up and saw that two hours had passed since she started painting.\nAunt Wu came in after knocking on the door and said, \u201cI was playing with Little Chestnut. The camera on her neck is a little hot. Should I take it off?\u201d\n\u201cA little hot? I\u2019ll go downstairs right now. Does she look uncomfortable? Let\u2019s take it off first.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan did not expect the camera to have a problem. She had never encountered such a thing before so she was afraid that it would hurt Little Chestnut.\n\u201cShe didn\u2019t show any discomfort nor did she look like she wanted to take it off,\u201d Aunt Wu said.\n\u201cLet\u2019s just take it off first.\u201d\nAunt Wu went downstairs and removed the camera from Little Chestnut\u2019s neck.\nShe did know much about technology and did not turn the camera off. She only put it on the table after she removed it..\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

Then, she went to check on the camera, which had been linked to her phone. She was afraid of being scalded so she touched it gingerly. Even then, she was still surprised by how hot it was.\n\u201cIt\u2019s so hot! It could have burned Little Chestnut\u2019s neck! Is this the quality of an expensive camera?\u201d\nAunt Wu leaned over and touched the camera as well before she remarked, \u201cWhy does it feel hotter than before?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan said worriedly, \u201cIt won\u2019t suddenly explode, right?\u201d\nAt this time, Lin Xiaowan glanced at the live broadcast and was taken aback. \u201cAll, there are so many people?\u201d\nAt this time, there were more than 1,000 viewers.\n[Netizen #1: Oh, it seems like the owner finally noticed us!]\n[Netizen #2: When will the live stream continue? I like this point of view!]\n[Netizen #3:1 prefer to look at the cute little baby!]\n[Netizen #4: It seems like something happened.]\n[Netizen #5: The camera is hot.]\n[Netizen #6:1 want to see Little Chestnut! * throws tantrum*]\nFortunately, the camera was aimed at Little Chestnut\u2019s living area.\nLin Xiaowan looked at the statistics and the viewers. It was rather lively in the live broadcast room. She had earned more than ten yuan in two hours.\nWhen she read the last comment, she explained, \u201cSince this is Little Chestnut\u2019s account, I thought I\u2019d let her do a live stream on her own.\u201d\nHowever, she had ignored the fact that people could not see Little Chestnut since the camera was placed on its neck.\n\u201cThe camera is really hot. Although Little Chestnut didn\u2019t show any discomfort, I won\u2019t let her wear it anymore\u2026\u201d\nSeeing that so many people wanted to see Little Chestnut, Lin Xiaowan called out for it.\n\nLittle Chestnut\u2019s living area was not small. She called out a few times, looking for it, before it finally meowed delicately. However, it still did not come over.\n\u201cShe\u2019s gone off to play. I\u2019m going to disconnect this camera first, and broadcast live with my phone. It\u2019ll save me the trouble of recording videos.\u201d\nWith just a little searching, Lin Xiaowan figured out how to turn off and disconnect the camera.\nJust as Lin Xiaowan turned the live broadcast on again, Little Chestnut finally appeared. Perhaps it did not see Lin Xiaowan after Lin Xianwan called for it so it took the initiative to run over.\nThe clingy kitten stuck close to Lin Xiaowan\u2019s calf and rubbed against it.\nLin Xiaowan chuckled softly and aimed the camera at it as she stroked it with her other hand.\nLittle Chestnut lay down and meowed, looking extremely cute.\n[Netizen #1: Why is this kitten so clingy?]\n[Netizen #2: Does such a cat really exist?]\n[Netizen #3: Such a kitten is born to be kissed!]\n[Netizen #4: She\u2019s so good at acting cute! She sounds so cute as well!]\nNetizen #5: My unfilial cat only cares about eating!]\n[Netizen #6: What kind of cat is this? Its fur is curly, long, and fluffy. Its color is also quite unique. I\u2019ve never seen anything like it\u2026]\n[Netizen #7: Little Chestnut is just an ordinary local cat. It used to be a stray before it was adopted.]\nLin Xiaowan was teasing Little Chestnut with a cat teaser when Aunt Wu brought Little Chestnut\u2019s food over.\n\u201cHer food is ready\u2026\u201d\nIt was time for Little Chestnut\u2019s dinner.\nLin Xiaowan sat cross-legged on the floor and said, \u201cAlright, we\u2019ll end the live broadcast after Little Chestnut is done eating.\u201d\nShe placed the phone at the side. It only showed Little Chestnut, and she could be seen at all.\nThe amount of food Little Chestnut ate was not a lot, but there were a lot of varieties. As it grew older, the variety only grew. The chef would even put ingredients aside to cook for it.\nLin Xiaowan adjusted the ceramic bowl that contained Little Chestnut\u2019s food before she looked at the other bowl that contained mixed fruit juice.\n\u201cAlright, let\u2019s see what\u2019s for dinner today,\u201d Lin Xiaowan said before she asked Aunt Wu, \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s freshly squeezed juice. I\u2019ll give you a glass later,\u201d Aunt Wu replied.\n\nLittle Chestnut\u2019s tail swayed in the air as it sat in a dignified manner. It meowed softly as it looked at Lin Xiaowan.\n[Netizen #1: Little Chestnut\u2019s food is really varied!]\n[Netizen #2: It\u2019s as though Little Chestnut is a baby!]\n[Netizen #3:1 agree! In fact, when I watched the previous videos, I thought that a lot of Little Chestnut\u2019s food is like food that little children eat!]\n[Netizen #4: The cat\u2019s food is better than mine\u2026]\n[Netizen #5: Not only does it eat better than me, but it also eats healthier than me. I\u2019m so jealous!]\n[Netizen #6: How obedient! It even knows to stay still when its mouth is being wiped!]\n[Netizen #7: The owner\u2019s hands are so fair and pretty!]\n[Netizen #8: If you look at one of the previous videos, there was a scene where the sun was just shining in at the right angle. Little Chestnut\u2019s mother\u2019s hands looked like they were glowing!]\n[Netizen #9: I\u2019ve seen how Little Chestnut looked at the beginning.

Just look at Little Chestnut.\u201d\nThen, she scratched Little Chestnut\u2019s chin and asked, \u201cIsn\u2019t that right, Little Chestnut?\u201d\nLittle Chestnut purred a few times in response.\nSoon enough, it was time for Lin Xiaowan to submit her painting for the Venus Hope Competition. She was not particularly satisfied with her work, but it was the best she could do.\nThe prizes for the winners had not been announced yet. Although she did not think she had a high chance of winning, she was still very curious about the prizes.\nAfter the artworks were submitted, it was time for the public to vote. It was open to everyone, and it was like a pre-selection round. More than half would be able to advance to the next round. The final results would be announced after the new year.\nThe weather was getting colder and colder so the indoor heating was turned on. It was dry in the north so the humidifiers on both the living room and the bedroom were turned on as well.\nOne day, when Huo Zheng was away on a business trip, Lin Xiaowan forgot to turn on the humidifier before she went to bed. When she woke up, she discovered that something was wrong..\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

Not only that, but her voice also became hoarse. Normally, a fever did not always come with a sore throat. However, her respiratory tract had been damaged once and was especially fragile. As such, it was easily affected.\nBack then, Lin Xiaowan was still unconscious, and the doctor spoke to Huo Zheng about her condition. As such, she was unaware of her condition. She only thought she had eaten too many snacks.\nAunt Wu stewed pear soup with lily tremella, lotus seed, and rock sugar for her, which was especially soothing to the throat.\nThe weather was cold, and Lin Xiaowan was not very willing to leave the house to see a doctor. Moreover, she assumed she would be fine after a day.\nAunt Wu could not persuade her so she secretly told Huo Zheng about it when she saw Lin Xiaowan continuing to eat potato chips. There was nothing she could do about it. Lin Xiaowan only listened to Huo Zheng. Even then, as soon as Lin Xiaowan acted coquettishly with him, he would give in to her.\nAt night, Huo Zheng arrived a few hours earlier. As soon as he entered the house, Lin Xiaowan\u2019s first reaction was to hide the junk food. She was having fried chicken and a hamburger for dinner.\nHuo Zheng smiled.\nAt this time, Lin Xiaowan was live streaming. Ever since the camera heated up, she no longer put it on Little Chestnut. She was busy and did not buy a new camera. Occasionally, she would use her phone to live broadcast. The camera would be focused on the scratching posts so she did not need to do anything. It was just that the shooting range was limited, and Little Chestnut did not appear often in front of the camera.\nNow that she had submitted her artwork, she had more free time so she had been looking at mini cameras online. She could not decide on which one to buy so she put it on hold.\nIn the living room, Lin Xiaowan looked at Huo Zheng, whose expression was a little unhappy, guiltily.\nLittle Chestnut leaped over suddenly toward the scratching post, and a robust figure appeared on the live stream. However, as it leaped up, its furry tail accidentally knocked over a porcelain decorative item.\nA loud noise rang out immediately near Huo Zheng.\nLittle Chestnut jumped up, frightened by the sudden noise.\nLin Xiaowan was also startled.\nMany exclamation marks could be seen in the comment section at this moment, especially from those who also had cats themselves.\n\u201cHow many things has it broken until now?\u201d Huo Zheng asked, massaging his temples.\n\nLin Xiaowan casually placed her phone on the coffee table with the camera facing up. The only thing that could be seen was the huge crystal chandelier and the high ceiling.\nLin Xiaowan felt extremely guilty for eating and drinking without care in Huo Zheng\u2019s absence. The packaging of the burger and remains were still on the table, and she instinctively wanted to flatter Huo Zheng.\nHowever, as soon as she rose to her feet, Huo Zheng said in a low voice, \u201cSit down.\u201d\nHer feet were bare, and the floor was cold. Although there was heating on the floor, Huo Zheng still could not help but frown when he saw this scene. He asked, \u201cWhere are your slippers?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan tried to hide her feet as she said hoarsely, \u201cIn the bedroom\u2026\u201d\nBefore Huo Zheng went to the bedroom to get her slippers, he reminded her, \u201cWait. Don\u2019t step on the shards of glass. I\u2019ll settle the score with you later.\u201d [Netizen #1: Is that Little Chestnut\u2019s father?]\n[Netizen #2: Yes. Little Chestnut\u2019s father seems to be very busy with work. He usually doesn\u2019t show up in the live broadcasts. He only appeared once before. However, his deep voice is very recognizable.]\n[Netizen #3: His voice sounds very good!]\n[Netizen #4: I\u2019m going to die from laughing too much.]\n[Netizen #5: Little Chestnut\u2019s mother sounds like she\u2019s panicking. By the way, the perspective of the camera is very unique\u2026]\nAt this moment, Aunt Wu quickly came over and cleaned up the glass shards.\nLin Xiaowan curled up on the couch and ruffled the furball as she said with a sigh, \u201cYour mother is going to be taught a lesson later\u2026 When your father comes down, I\u2019ll tell him these are all for you. I\u2019m sorry! I\u2019ll tell him to give you a bigger play area in the future!\u201d\nLittle Chestnut meowed a few times, and Lin Xiaowan considered it an acquiescence. She had forgotten that her phone was still broadcasting at this moment.\n[Netizen #1: Little Chestnut\u2019s mother is a little cute! Hahaha!\n[Netizen #2: Poor Little Chestnut!]\n[Netizen #3: Little Chestnut\u2019s mother\u2019s voice is so soft. She\u2019ll definitely sound good when she cries. Hehe!]\n[Netizen #4: Wake up! This is a cat live broadcast!]\n[Netizen #5: Do you hear Little Chestnut meowing? It\u2019s judging you!]\nLittle Chestnut continued to meow, acting coquettishly to Lin Xiaowan.\n\nWhen Huo Zheng came down, he did not only bring Lin Xiaowan\u2019s slippers, but he brought the trash bag in the bedroom down as well.\nLin Xiaowan held her breath and stopped petting Little Chestnut immediately when she saw this. She had eaten spicy sticks and some jelly yesterday night, and she had thrown their wrappings in the trash can.\nAunt Wu brought honey water and left to throw the trash while Huo Zheng sat down next to Lin Xiaowan.\n\u201cDrink some.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan took the cup, looking extremely obedient at this moment.\nLittle Chestnut had never been very close to Huo Zheng. As soon as he sat down, it jumped off the couch arrogantly to play by itself. It was safe for it to play since Aunt Wu had already cleaned up the glass shards.\n\u201cYou ate these things when I wasn\u2019t around, huh? Did you think I would not know when the chef did not come?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan lowered her head and protested weakly, \u201cThe chef came in the afternoon.\u201d\nHuo Zheng looked at the lunch menu and said, \u201cSweet and sour tenderloin, pork strips stir-fried with fish sauce, and chicken feet? The only vegetable you had was the spinach and egg dish. Even then, 1 heard you didn\u2019t eat the spinach.\u201d\n\u201cSpinach is bitter and not tasty\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWhen did you go to the supermarket to buy these snacks?\u201d\nWhen Huo Zheng left not long ago, the chef made some healthy snacks without preservatives. That was it. However, when he returned, he saw that there were a lot of spicy snacks, jelly, chips, and biscuits. It was no wonder that he was angry.\n\u201cAfter dinner yesterday,\u201d Lin Xiaowan replied honestly.\nHuo Zheng pulled her into his arms before he lowered her head and whispered into her ear, \u201cDo you want to be taught a lesson?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan\u2019s ears turned red immediately. \u201cNo.\u201d\nEver since Lin Xiaowan was hospitalized at the end of last year, Huo Zheng had been quite strict with her diet. It had been almost a year, but he did not relax at all. She could only eat the food outside a few times, and she was about to die from her cravings.\n\u201cI want to eat octopus balls,\u201d Lin Xiaowan said when she recalled the octopus balls that Gu Yuwu bought her previously.\n\u201cYou still dare to make a request? I\u2019ll bring you to the doctor tomorrow.\u201d\nHuo Zheng thought about the time she was hospitalized. At that time, the doctor told him that Lin Xiaowan had to be extra careful when she had a fever or caught a cold since it might affect her respiratory system. As such, he could not help but worry.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a mild fever. There\u2019s no need to see a doctor,\u201d Lin Xiaowan said. She did not think it was serious.\n\u201cBe good and listen to me,\u201d Huo Zheng said, coaxing her, before he kissed her forehead..\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

I\u2019ll consider letting you eat it after your throat recovers.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan looked at the empty table and sighed.\n\u201cAlright, go brush your teeth and wash up before you sleep.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan failed to carry out her original plan to blame Little Chestnut. She felt that Huo Zheng was not really angry. He did not raise his voice at all; in fact, it was rather gentle. At most, his expression was a little serious.\nLin Xiaowan had been thinking about a matter recently. She decided to mention it to Huo Zheng at this moment. She said, \u201c1 want to use one of the rooms for Little Chestnut. I\u2019ve been doing live broadcasts of Little Chestnut recently. It\u2019ll be easier to film Little Chestnut in a room compared to the living room.\u201d\nIn fact, their house was not small. Even Aunt Wu had a room in the house for the occasional times she stayed over. However, the other rooms were all in use. There was Huo Zheng\u2019s gym, Lin Xiaowan\u2019s storage room where she built the building blocks and kept them, Lin Xiaowan\u2019s studio, and the home theater.\nLin Xiaowan thought about it for a moment before she said, \u201cI\u2019ve not used that small room where I keep my building blocks for a long time now. I can tidy the room up and turn it into a playroom for Little Chestnut.\u201d\nHuo Zheng was not willing to touch Lin Xiaowan\u2019s room for a cat. He did not respond to her request and only said, \u201cGo brush your teeth first.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan grabbed his hand and shook it. \u201cCan I turn that room into Little Chestnut\u2019s playroom?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Huo Zheng replied with a hint of helplessness.\nIt was rare for Huo Zheng to reject her so decisively so she was momentarily stunned. She asked with widened eyes, \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cThe room is yours,\u201d Huo Zheng said. He did not explain too much. However, seeing how much she wanted a playroom for Little Chestnut, he asked, \u201cShould we move to a bigger place?\u201d\n\u201cWhere?\u201d\n\u201cI have a three-story house in Xilin Imperial Garden. Although it\u2019s empty, someone has been cleaning it regularly. It\u2019s quite close to the central area of Shengjing; it\u2019s a quiet place in the downtown area,\u201d Huo Zheng said, \u201cHowever, it was built quite a while ago so the facilities are old. The heating system there has yet to be turned on this year. We\u2019ll need to check the place out first. If we decide to move, we can do it after the new year.\u201d\n\nLin Xiaowan was quite hesitant. She did not really want to move.\nHuo Zheng leaned over and easily carried Lin Xiaowan, who was acting shamelessly on the couch. He held her waist with one hand and her butt with the other, carrying her to the bathroom to wash up before sleeping.\nLin Xiaowan did not have the habit of playing with her phone, and she did not keep it with her everywhere she went. As such, her phone was left on the coffee table in the living room, forgotten.\nA moment later, the lights in the living room were turned off. It was pitch black, and only a few occasional sounds of movements from Little Chestnut could be heard. After a while, it fell silent.\nHowever, Lin Xiaowan\u2019s live broadcast was still on. Since it was pitch black, there was no difference whether it was on or not.\n[Netizen #1: It seems like Little Chestnut\u2019s mother completely forgot about the live broadcast.]\n[Netizen #2: It\u2019s obvious that the couple has gone to bed.]\n[Netizen #3: It\u2019s already midnight after all.]\n[Netizen #4: Sigh. I didn\u2019t get to hear Little Chestnut\u2019s mother cry when she was scolded. Little Chestnut\u2019s parents are so gentle when they talk\u2026]\n[Netizen #5: Put away your dangerous thoughts!]\n[Netizen #6: Little Chestnut\u2019s father has a really nice voice. It has the charm of a mature man\u2026]\n[Netizen #7: Ahhh! I understand what you mean!]\n[Netizen #8: Little Chestnut\u2019s father really dotes on Little Chestnut\u2019s mother. As soon as he arrived, he went to get slippers for her. He even spoke to her about eating too many snacks and wants her to see a doctor tomorrow. You can see he really cares about her.]\n[Netizen #9: Yes, yes, yes! Not only that, but when she suggested converting her room into a playroom for Little Chestnut, it\u2019s obvious that he refused because the room belongs to her. He even wanted to move so she did not have to sacrifice her room!]\n[Netizen #10; If I didn\u2019t hear wrongly, he mentioned Xilin Imperial Garden, right?]\n[Netizen #11: I\u2019ve never heard of it. Why?]\n[Netizen #12: Xilin Imperial Garden is one of the most central locations in Shengjing. You can look it up yourself.]\n[Netizen #13:1 can only say that even if you have money, you may not be able to live there. It seems like Little Chestnut\u2019s parents are not ordinary people\u2026]\n[Netizen #14: Alright, alright, let\u2019s just focus on the cat. Don\u2019t think too much when you\u2019re looking at cats!]\n\n[Netizen #15: Seeing that there\u2019s no sound, Little Chestnut is already asleep. Moreover, we can\u2019t see anything!]\nThe phone screen was on the entire time. After some time, a warning notification, indicating the battery was low, popped up. Not long after, the battery was exhausted, and the phone automatically shut down. With that, Little Chestnut\u2019s live broadcast also came to an end.\nThe weather was getting colder and colder. Now that it was December, Lin Xiaowan\u2019s birthday was fast approaching.\nThe company was very busy since it was the end of the year. Huo Zheng worked non-stop for half a month before he could take a few days off to celebrate Lin Xiaowan\u2019s birthday.\n\u201cI\u2019ve prepared a birthday present for you,\u201d Huo Zheng said.\nThey were catching a flight today.\nLin Xiaowan\u2019s throat had fully recovered. Recently, she did not have much to do. It was too cold so she did not go to the dessert shop. She did not want to leave the house at all. At this time, she had just woken up from her nap. Her face was red from sleep.\nHuo Zheng could not but reach out to stroke her cheek.\nShe yawned and rubbed her eyes before she let Huo Zheng help her put on a white wool sweater. She said, \u201cYou haven\u2019t told me where we are going. Why are you being so mysterious?\u201d\nHuo Zheng chuckled as he helped her put on her coat and wrapped a scarf around her neck.\nLin Xiaowan tugged at her scarf and complained, \u201cThere\u2019s no need for it to be so thick. It\u2019s not cold in the car and on the plane.\nShe waddled like a penguin when she walked due to the layers of clothes she was wearing.\n\u201cThe weather is bad, and the wind is strong.\u201d\nTheir destination was Chahar.\nWhen they landed and disembarked from the plane, they got into the car and drove for a few hours, leaving the city. After a while, only large expanses of grasslands could be seen on both sides of the road.\nIt was already past 8 PM at this time. During winter, the sky had already long darkened at this time. However, in Chahar, it had only turned dark not long ago.\nAs the car sped past, golden lamps hanging on nomadic tents could be seen occasionally.\nLin Xiaowan had never been to such a place before. She leaned against the car window and looked outside curiously. Although it was winter, the land was not barren.\nIt became more and more deserted as they drove.\nSeeing this, an idea appeared in Lin Xiaowan\u2019s mind. She turned around and asked the man who was hugging her, \u201cAre we going to stay in a tent?\u201d\nIt would be uncomfortable to live in a tent during winter so Huo Zheng did not have such a plan.. However, seeing the interest in her eyes, he asked, \u201cDo you want to stay in a tent?\u201d\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

I was just asking. Let\u2019s just follow your plan,\u201d Lin Xiaowan said.\nIn the end, they drove to Chahar\u2019s Kongjing Salt Lake. It was a very remote place, but the closer they got, the more lights they could see. The orange-red lights were not very bright, and they illuminated the horses that were wandering the grassland.\nBefore getting out of the car, Lin Xiaowan was wrapped tightly by Huo Zheng.\nThere were tents set up in the open space, and some professional equipment had been set up. A few people were scattered here and there, and the low sounds of conversations could be heard in the air. A few people were even broadcasting live.\nUpon seeing this, Lin Xiaowan felt that her initial guess was wrong. She looked at the time; it was already past 10 PM. Normally, this was when she would start getting ready for bed. Earlier, when they were in the car, Huo Zheng had already told her that they would not be following their normal routine, meaning they were staying up late today.\nIt was unknown what the horses wore, but when they walked, there was a faint but clear tinkling sound.\nThe stars in the sky were exceptionally bright without the pollution of lights. This place was far from the city after all.\nLin Xiaowan asked curiously, \u201cWhat are we doing here?\u201d\nHuo Zheng gave a few instructions to the two people who followed him here. When he walked over to Lin Xiaowan\u2019s side, he happened to see a faint light flashing past in the sky before disappearing. He asked with a smile, \u201cDidn\u2019t you say you want to watch a meteor shower? I can\u2019t bring you to the moon for now, but I can still satisfy your wish to see a meteor shower.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan was shocked. She looked at him and asked, \u201cWe\u2019re really going to watch a meteor shower?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan always thought that she could only watch meteor showers with some sophisticated and expensive equipment. She was unaware that all she had to do was look up.\nAt this time, Huo Zheng\u2019s two employees had already set up two reclining chairs in a strategic place. There was also a small wooden table next to the chairs. Some preserved fruits and snacks had already been placed on the table as well. The snacks were kept in transparent containers. It was obvious that they were made by the chef and could not be bought outside.\n\nThe sound of someone doing a live broadcast drifted over. The other party was playing music and interacting with the viewers from time to time.\nLin Xiaowan leaned back on the chair, satisfied. Huo Zheng had brought her a blanket and a pillow so it was extremely comfortable.\nWhen she finally saw the meteor shower, she was slightly stunned.\nMeteor showers in real life were completely different from those shown on television.\nIn the dark sky dotted with stars, a thin line appeared briefly before disappearing quickly.\nLin Xiaowan was so stunned that she did not even have time to make a wish. Nonetheless, she still felt very moved.\n\u201cSo a meteor shower looks like this\u2026\u201d\nSeeing the dazed expression on Lin Xiaowan\u2019s face, Huo Zheng asked with a smile, \u201cWhat do you think it looks like?\u201d\n\u201cNot like this,\u201d Lin Xiaowan murmured. Then, she leaned on him before she said with a smile, \u201cI really like lying here and watching the meteor shower\u2026\u201d\nHuo Zheng looked at the faintly lit clock on the wooden table. There were still 47 minutes left before her birthday. He asked softly, \u201cAre you sleepy?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m not sleepy at all. Are you sleepy? Do you want to take a nap?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not sleepy.\u201d\nThe two of them exchanged a few words before an extremely beautiful meteor with a green tail streaked across the sky and disappeared into the pitch-black night.\nA small commotion could be heard when it fell.\nJust like before, Lin Xiaowan did not have time to make a wish. She looked at the man who was holding her and asked, \u201cDid you make a wish?\u201d\n\nHuo Zheng paused for a moment before he said, \u201cI didn\u2019t.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan was not surprised by this. Perhaps it was due to the environment, her mind could not help but drift a little. In fact, Huo Zheng\u2019s answer did not matter to her. Her question was just a precursor to what she wanted to say.\n\u201cI wanted to make a wish earlier,\u201d Lin Xiaowan said, \u201cHowever, I couldn\u2019t think of any wish.\u201d\n\u201cHmm?\u201d\n\u201cI thought about it, but 1 realized that somehow all my wishes in the past have been fulfilled,\u201d Lin Xiaowan said solemnly.\nHuo Zheng moved closer, curious, before he asked softly, \u201cWhat wishes did you have?\u201d\n\u201cHmmm\u2026 For example, a long time ago, before I met you, I wished that 1 had enough\u2026\u201d\n\u201cHad enough?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s right. I had nothing at that time. That was why I wished I had enough to eat when I\u2019m hungry, had money to see the doctor when I was sick, had a place to sleep when I was sleepy\u2026\u201d\n\u201cThen you can always find a new wish\u2026 For example, you can wish for health so you won\u2019t fall sick\u2026\u201d\nLin Xiaowan nodded, agreeing with him. A few meteors fell while she said, \u201cThen when the next one appears, I\u2019ll wish for us to be healthy.\u201d\nPersonally, Huo Zheng did not believe in such things. He firmly believed that his fate was controlled by himself. It was better to depend on himself than on some strange beliefs. However, after listening to Lin Xiaowan, he did not say anything and nodded obediently.\nBefore midnight arrived, Lin Xiaowan finally managed to make a wish, wishing for both her and Huo Zheng to be healthy and safe.\nHuo Zheng glanced at the ticking clock before he withdrew his hands from Lin Xiaowan and rose to his feet. He explained, \u201cI\u2019ll go get something.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan did not ask about it and only said with a nod, \u201cHmm.\u201d\nHuo Zheng went to the car and returned very quickly. His expression was calm, but his palms were slightly sweaty. He crouched down in front of Lin Xiaowan as he calmly said, \u201cYour shoelaces are undone\u2026\u201d\nLin Xiaowan watched as he placed her foot on his thigh and lowered his head as he seriously tied the shoelace of her calf-length boot for her..\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

He crouched down in front of Lin Xiaowan and held her hand gently.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Lin Xiaowan asked when she saw that he was not himself.\nHuo Zheng brought out a velvet octagonal box that he had hidden for a long time. He opened it, revealing a simple ring before asking gently, \u201cDo you want to get engaged to me? I know you\u2019ve agreed, but I want to make it formal\u2026\u201d\nLin Xiaowan looked at the ring curiously. \u201cWhen did you buy it?\u201d\nThe jewelry that Huo Zheng gave her naturally could not be bought outside. It was unique and custom-made. This meant that it would take some time due to the preparation needed. Putting other factors aside, with how picky Huo Zheng was, it must have taken a long time before he approved the design. One could only imagine how many drafts the designer had to submit to the cold Huo Zheng for approval. It was likely that the designer felt like punching Huo Zheng many times during the process.\nHuo Zheng stroked her hand gently. He did not answer. Instead, he asked in return, \u201cHave you thought about your answer?\u201d\nThen, without waiting for her reply, he took the ring out and put it on her finger. He kissed the back of her hand gently after that and said, \u201cIt looks good on you.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan asked with a smile, \u201cAren\u2019t you going to wait for my answer?\u201d\nHuo Zheng replied confidently, \u201cYou\u2019ve already agreed before this\u2026\u201d\nHe returned to his seat and pulled her into his arms. Then, he lowered his head and kissed her gently before he said, \u201cHappy birthday.\u201d\nIt was fifteen minutes past midnight; it was Lin Xiaowan\u2019s 24th birthday.\nThe meteors were still falling in the sky.\n\nLin Xiaowan was wrapped in a small blanket as she nestled in his arms. She stretched her arm and looked at the ring on her finger. She suddenly thought of something and asked, \u201cDidn\u2019t you already give me a ring last year?\u201d\nAt that time, she had just been reborn. Huo Zheng had proposed with that ring, and when she wanted to break up with him, she had returned the ring. At some point, the ring was thrown away because of Song Zhiyi. In any case, her finger had been empty since she woke up in the hospital last year.\n\u201cIs this the same as that one?\u201d\n\u201cNo. That ring isn\u2019t good, and it\u2019s inauspicious,\u201d Huo Zheng said.\nAlthough it was winter, the temperature in Chahar\u2019s Kongjing Salt Lake was not too cold. Lin Xiaowan found it very comfortable to curl up in the recliner.\n\u201cI often saw stars in my hometown when I was young,\u201d Lin Xiaowan suddenly said.\nApart from that one time when Huo Zheng investigated her, he had never taken the initiative to ask about her past. This was also her first time taking the initiative to talk about it.\n\u201cBeicheng is my hometown. It was still a county when I was young. At that time, many people would sit outside during summer nights to enjoy the breeze. As soon as you raised your head, you\u2019d be able to see many stars in the sky\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI lived there for many years, and my time there feels distant to me. It seems like there\u2019s nothing worth remembering there for me,\u201d Lin Xiaowan slowly said.\nShe was the only one left in the family. She did not regret leaving home. After she was admitted to university, apart from studying, she worked part-time jobs, focusing on earning money. The part-time jobs in Shengjing paid twice as much compared to Beicheng. However, expenses and rent in Shengjing were not as low as in Beicheng. Fortunately, she lived on campus so she did not have to worry about rent. The fee was only a few hundred yuan a year. At that time, although she was very frugal, she did not feel like she was suffering.\n\u201cHowever, everything seemed to have changed for the better after 1 met you,\u201d Lin Xiaowan said. Then, she said with a scoff, \u201cHowever, we have to exclude that time when your detestable ex-girlfriend appeared.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t mention her. It\u2019s unlucky,\u201d Huo Zheng said before kissing her.\n\u201cAlright, alright,\u201d Lin Xiaowan said before she asked, \u201cDid you only buy one ring? Am 1 the only one wearing a ring? Are you single?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026 1\u201911 wear it when we go back\u2026\u201d\nHuo Zheng made a pair of rings. However, he only brought one here. Although he had spoken confidently earlier, he was in fact a little uncertain in his heart.\n\nThe two leaned against each other and whispered to each other as they watched the meteor shower.\nAfter a while, a live streamer walked over and asked if it was okay if they appeared in his broadcast.\nLin Xiaowan looked at Huo Zheng.\nThe other party was a middle-aged man with a mustache. He looked kind and honest. He explained, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. Your faces won\u2019t be seen since it\u2019s so dark. 1 just want to film in this direction\u2026 1\u201911 be filming from over there. The camera will be mostly focused on the sky. 1 just thought the background here is better than that of the monotonous mountain. Moreover, I really like your setup here. It\u2019s caught my eye since earlier.\u201d\nA warm orange lamp hung next to the duo as they sat on comfortable recliners with a round wooden table at the side. It looked very cozy, and the atmosphere was warm.\nFrom the perspective of the camera, such a small corner under the night sky was like a painting.\nLin Xiaowan thought about it for a moment. In fact, it did not matter. It was truly dark, and it would be difficult to see them.\nSince Lin Xiaowan did not have any objections, Huo Zheng naturally did not have any objections either.\nThe man\u2019s live broadcast was usually related to astronomy. He brought all kinds of equipment here this time. After setting up the live broadcast again, he took a photo of the duo with an instant camera before he jogged over to show it to them.\nThe photo only showed their backs and the vast sky.\nLin Xiaowan liked it very much. \u201cWow, it\u2019s really beautiful. Thank you.\u201d\nThe man nodded politely before he returned to his original position.\nAs it grew later, the wind began to blow. At some point, Lin Xiaowan had fallen asleep while she watched the meteor shower. Since they were not staying in a tent, Huo Zheng did not wake her up and carried her into the car, making their way to the accommodation that had been arranged.\nSince Huo Zheng took a few days off, they had time to explore Chahar. However, there was not much to see in winter since the scenery was not as vivid as it would be during spring and summer.\nThe activities during winter were the usual snowboarding, ice-skating, soaking in hot springs, and the like..\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

However, the temperature was relatively high over the past few days. Let alone snow, even dark clouds could not be seen.\nThe first thing they did after returning to Shengjing was to pick up Little Chestnut from the pet shop.\nThe pet shop was located close to their house. Many people in their residential area would send their pets here. The shop also had in-house vets so it was very reassuring.\nAfter staying in the pet shop for three or four days, Little Chestnut was very clingy. When it saw Lin Xiaowan again, it purred and rubbed against her for a long time, following her wherever she went.\nLin Xiaowan reached out and tapped Little Chestnut\u2019s forehead as she said, \u201cLittle Chestnut, you\u2019re too loud\u2026\u201d\nLittle Chestnut ignored Lin Xiaowan and continued to meow.\nAfter playing with Little Chestnut and feeding it treats, she went to look for Huo Zheng, asking him to wear his ring.\nHuo Zheng chuckled and did as he was told before he pulled her into his arms and kissed her.\nLin Xiaowan painted the photo that they had taken in Chahar\u2019s Kongjing Salt Lake. She added Little Chestnut into her painting as well. She painted Little Chestnut lying on a small bed lazily as it ate its treats.\nShe was very satisfied with the photo and the painting so she posted both to her Speaker account.\nIt had been a while since she updated her account. She had spent most of her time relaxing recently. After submitting her artwork for the Venus Hope Competition, she did not do much apart from completing the homework given by Hong Minhua.\nEver since her Speaker account was exposed, her followers had increased by dozens of times. When she posted the photo and painting, there were many likes and comments. Some people even reposted them.\n\nUnder the photos, she wrote, \u2018When 1 was watching the meteor shower, a kind man took this photo. I really liked the photo so 1 painted it when I got home. Naturally, I have to add my beloved Little Chestnut into the painting\u2019.\n[Netizen #1: Wow, is the starry sky real? It\u2019s too dreamy!]\n[Netizen #2: There are two people in the photo! Look at that jawline! Did the lady boss go on a trip with President Huo?]\n[Netizen #3: The photo is really good. It even captured the falling meteor. Ahhhh, I\u2019m so envious!]\n[Netizen #4: Did the president try to satisfy his wife\u2019s wish? Where was that? They didn\u2019t really go to the moon, did they?]\n[Netizen #5: There was a meteor shower a few days ago. This has to be the end-of-the-year Geminid meteor shower.]\n[Netizen #6: Damn! I saw @XiaoMingtheAstronomyGuide broadcast the Geminid meteor shower. 1 saw a scene of this photo at that time! As it turns out, it\u2019s President Huo and the lady!]\n[Netizen #7: You mean, lady boss? I can see how excited you are based on your typo.]\n[Netizen #8:1 saw that as well! I thought the photo looked a little familiar, but I couldn\u2019t recall where I\u2019d seen it until you mentioned the meteor shower!] [Netizen #9: So the kind man she mentioned is Xiao Ming?]\nLin Xiaowan rarely paid attention to Speaker account. After posting the photo and the painting, she put her phone aside immediately. She was naturally unaware that Xiao Ming, a popular astronomy influencer, had liked and reposted her post.\n[Xiao Ming the Astronomy Guide: I didn\u2019t expect the couple I met to be President Huo and his wife. Otherwise, I would\u2019ve taken advantage of President Huo\u2019s luck and made a wish to earn more money next year!]\nXiao Ming had millions of fans. He was very popular and influential. Initially, nothing much happened after he reposted Lin Xiaowan\u2019s photo and painting. However, due to various factors, Lin Xiaowan\u2019s Bobo Star\u2019s account, or to be precise, Little Chestnut\u2019s account, was found.\nThis was thanks to a netizen whose ability was like that of Sherlock Holmes.\n[Netizen #1: Hey, the cat\u2019s color and fur are really unique. It resembles Little Chestnut. Is it Little Chestnut from Bobo Star?]\nWith this, Little Chestnut\u2019s account was exposed.\n\n[Netizen #1: The cats look the same. Moreover, Little Chestnut\u2019s mother said that she would be away for a few days so there\u2019d be no live broadcasts. Everything matches! ]\n[Netizen #2: Oh my gosh! Is Little Huhu\u2019s mother the lady boss of Huo Corporation?!]\n[Netizen #3: It seems like Little Chestnut has been adopted into a wealthy family! ]\n[Netizen #4: If this is true, then based on that time when the lady boss forgot to turn off the live broadcast, their relationship is super sweet!]\n[Netizen #5:1 remember! President Huo was really gentle to his wife!]\n[Netizen #6: Somehow 1 feel happy seeing how everyone\u2019s so shocked!]\nAfter two days, Lin Xiaowan prepared to start a live broadcast for Little Chestnutt. When she logged into Bobo Star, she was surprised by the countless messages and comments she received.\nInitially, she thought it was because her videos had been recommended by Bobo Star. As such, she was stunned when she saw the messages and comments referring to her as Huo Zheng\u2019s wife and asking about her trip.\nAfter a while, she also discovered that many of these people came here from Speaker, and an ominous feeling rose in her heart. When she finally logged onto Speaker and understood what happened, she was speechless.\n\u2018Why is the Internet so small? These cat lovers aren\u2019t just watching cat videos on Bobo Star, but they\u2019re also active on Speaker!\u2019\nFor a moment, Lin Xiaowan could not decide if she should continue with the live broadcast or not. Or perhaps she should return to recording videos of Little Chestnut\u2019s meals. However, she was rather lazy to edit the videos, especially after she had experienced the convenience of live streaming.\nIn the end, Lin Xiaowan chose to put her phone away. In her opinion, it was not shameful but useful to run away. She decided to pretend to be dead and pretend like she knew nothing.\nGu Yuwu was in the entertainment industry. Hence, she paid attention to what was happening on the Internet regularly. Although the news of Lin Xiaowan\u2019s encounter with Xiao Ming and the exposure of her account on Bobo Star was not trending, she was aware of it since she followed Lin Xiaowan. After all, Lin Xiaowan\u2019s posts would appear on her feed.\nWhen Gu Yuwu called Lin Xiaowan, she sighed emotionally and said, \u201c1 have to say that you\u2019re quite lucky. To be precise, you\u2019ll be considered very lucky if you\u2019re in the entertainment industry. Look at how popular you are\u2026\u201d\nLin Xiaowan was horrified when she heard this. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be in the entertainment industry!\u201d\nGu Yuwu laughed out loud. \u201cI know, I know.

Although it had not aired yet, it was already quite popular. Six episodes would be broadcasted every week, and it would not take long for her scenes to appear.\n\u201cAlright. I\u2019ll experience how it feels to see myself on television then\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll send you a small clip of your scenes so you can listen to the domineering voice of the voice actress!\u201d\nThe clip was not very long, but it took several minutes before it was sent.\nLin Xiaowan felt slightly strange when she saw herself. She also felt like she did not fit in with the style of the main characters. Her costumes were elaborate and exquisite. However, this was only normal since she played the character of the only goddess left in the world. The role did not require any acting skills from her. It was fine as long as she did not make any big mistakes.\nWhen Lin Xiaowan heard the dubbing for her lines, she fell silent.\n\u2018Why does it sound so dramatic?\u2019\nGu Yuwu seemed to have calculated the time before she sent her a message.\n[Gu Yuwu: Are you done watching it? What do you think?]\nAlthough Lin Xiaowan felt that the dubbing was out of character, she knew it was only because she was not used to it. At the same time, she also felt slightly guilty for not being able to say her lines.\n[Lin Xiaowan: It looks good. My performance seems\u2026 okay?]\nGu Yuwu was not stingy with her praise.\n\n[Gu Yuwu: I think your performance is good. This is the advantage of having no experience. You don\u2019t look like you\u2019re acting. Hahaha.]\n[Gu Yuwu: Do you feel like dubbing is incongruent with your face?]\n[Lin Xiaowan: What do you mean?]\nLin Xiaowan did not understand the term.\nGu Yuwu did not say anything and only sent her another clip. It was the same as before, but the voice was now different. It was much more childish, not as calm and domineering as before. She sounded like the girl next door.\nLin Xiaowan thought the voice matched her appearance, especially her face that still had a little baby fat. However\u2026\n[Lin Xiaowan: Don\u2019t you think the voice sounds a little young? After all, the character is that of a goddess, and she\u2019s lived for so many years. It\u2019s impossible for her to sound like a young and lively girl, right?]\nAlthough Lin Xiaowan had forgotten most of the scenes of the goddess, she still remembered the major key points.\n[Lin Xiaowan: Moreover, the goddess lives in the divine world alone. She\u2019s lonely with no one to talk to or play with. Although the second voice matches my appearance better, it doesn\u2019t seem to match the character.]\n[Gu Yuwu: We had a few voice actresses say those lines, but we weren\u2019t very satisfied. These two are the best. *sigh*]\n[Gu Yuwu: Why don\u2019t you try to say the lines?]\nLin Xiaowan was shocked when she saw the second message and wondered if Gu Yuwu was joking.\n[Lin Xiaowan: Huh? Are you serious? I\u2019ll probably sound like a little maidservant that the goddess kidnapped and brought to the divine world to play with.]\nLin Xiaowan refused several times, but in the end, she could not say no to Gu Yuwu. In exchange, Gu Yuwu promised to help her cover up in front of Huo Zheng when she ate spicy sticks. With this, she was successfully lured into the recording studio.\nIn the recording studio.\nThe voice actress who dubbed the goddess\u2019 character was also present.\n\nWhen Lin Xiaowan found out that the two contrasting voices she heard before were from the same person, she was filled with admiration. With a professional in front of her, she became even more embarrassed, which affected her performance.\nIn the end, Gu Yuwu brought her to an empty studio and passed the script to Lin Xiaowan before she said, \u201cAlright, try doing this alone. If you don\u2019t understand anything, let me know, understand? Make a signal. I can see you from outside.\u201d\n\u201cOkay!\u201d Lin Xiaowan replied, holding the script.\nNow that she was alone in the recording booth, she was much more relaxed. She flipped through the script and recalled the feeling of being a goddess. While she quickly went through the plot, the recording device was already on.\nWhen Lin Xiaowan started, she spoke slowly, afraid of making mistakes. However, when she spoke, her pitch would rise a little and fall, making her sound very coquettish.\nShe did not feel anything when she was saying her lines. When she was done, she gestured to Gu Yuwu, looking embarrassed.\nGu Yuwu could not help but laugh when she listened to Lin Xiaowan. She put her arm around Lin Xiaowan\u2019s shoulders as she said, \u201cThe voice sounds right this time. However, the aura of a goddess isn\u2019t there. It\u2019s just as you said\u2026\u201d\nHowever, when the voice actress heard it, she had her own opinion. She said, \u201cI think Miss Lin\u2019s habit of speaking in a high-pitch tone enriches the goddess\u2019 character. The contrast between the voice and the character is quite good.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan waved her hands and said, \u201cNo, no, you can just address me as Xiaowan.\u201d\nAfter all, the other party was a professional and a senior.\nThe voice actress was very gentle and magnanimous. She said kindly, \u201cNow that I\u2019ve met you and heard you say the lines, 1 kind of understand the problem with the previous dubbing. I have an idea. I\u2019ll try recording the lines again.\u201d\nThe voice actress practiced a few times before she started recording. She did not imitate Lin Xiaowan completely and only drew inspiration from it.\nLin Xiaowan did not understand anything. She only felt that the other party was really amazing.\nThis version did not sound lively or young, but it was calm and cold with a hint of arrogance. However, after talking to the priestess, she sounded different.\nLin Xiaowan did not know how to describe it. In any case, she did not sound so high and mighty anymore.\nOn the other hand, Gu Yuwu still felt that voice did not match the character. However, she had to admit that the latest version was the most pleasing to the ears so far..\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

However, Gu Yuwu saved Lin Xiaowan\u2019s version as well, thinking about releasing it as a bonus when the time came.\nLin Xiaowan said, puzzled, \u201cThese things are usually related to the main characters. 1 only have a few minutes of screen time. There\u2019s no need to do this, right?\u201d\n\u201cThis is your first time acting, and if I\u2019m not mistaken, this will also be the only time, right? You can keep it as a souvenir. 1\u201911 edit it before sending it to you. You can listen to it when you\u2019re old\u2026\u201d\nLin Xiaowan stroked her chin. She felt that Gu Yuwu\u2019s words made sense.\nThe lunar new year was fast approaching.\nThe Huo family planned to officially announce Huo Zheng\u2019s engagement to their social circles. However, they respected Lin Xiaowan\u2019s opinion and did not hold a public engagement ceremony.\nHowever, Huo Zheng felt that it was not that good if there was no news about the engagement at all. After all, who knew if people who were not afraid of death would create rumors? As such, he posted a picture using his personal social media account.\nUsually, Huo Zheng\u2019s social media account was managed by the company. This was also the first time he had posted something unrelated to the company.\nThe photo only showed two hands intertwined. The morning sunlight shone through the gap between the curtains into the dimly lit room. Lin Xiaowan was still sleeping in Huo Zheng\u2019s arms. He had held her hand and deliberately chosen an angle that showed their rings before taking a photo.\nAlthough he respected her opinion and did not make a big deal out of the engagement, he felt like he had to make some sort of announcement to the outside world that she was now his. He could not just cover everything up.\n\nOnce the photo was posted, it became a hot topic immediately. Moreover, the comments on this topic were a little\u2026 inappropriate.\nHuo Zheng rarely appeared in public events so he rarely made the headlines. Unless it was business-related, he usually maintained a low profile.\nHowever, his post this time generated a lot of interest because not long ago the netizens were already discussing this topic. This was all thanks to the meteor shower incident when Lin Xiaowan\u2019s social media was exposed after Xiao Ming, a popular astronomy influencer, reposted her post.\nNow that so many people knew that Lin Xiaowan was the wife of the president of the Huo Corporation, it was only natural that Huo Zheng\u2019s post would cause a commotion. After all, the post was also reposted by the Huo Corporation\u2019s official account.\nThe most ridiculous thing was that someone zoomed in on the photo, adjusting the exposure of the photo and such, to have a better look. After that, the person quickly left a comment, revealing that a hickey could be seen on Lin Xiaowan\u2019s wrist. Moreover, judging from the color, it seemed new.\nAfter that, the discussion in the comment section became even livelier. Even the number of reposts went up greatly.\nWhen Huo Zheng found out about this matter, his expression darkened immediately. He quickly ordered for the photo to be deleted. Alas, it was useless to delete now. It had already spread on the Internet.\nLin Xiaowan did not think much of this matter. She laughed and said, \u201cIt\u2019s just a small matter. Deleting it is only going to make people talk about it more and make them think that something happened.\u201d\nShe had also seen the discussion online. She was amazed by the netizen\u2019s rich imagination and ability to come up with stories.\nHuo Zheng narrowed his eyes as he held her in his arms. He said in a low voice, \u201cBut something did happen.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan rolled her eyes when she heard this.\nHuo Zheng had taken the photo the day after they were engaged. It was impossible that nothing happened the night of the engagement. At that time, he had said something that made her feel embarrassed so she quickly covered his mouth. Unexpectedly, he smiled and shamelessly left a hickey on her wrist.\nFinally, Lin Xiaowan said, \u201cIn any case, this is not my fault.\u201d\nHuo Zheng was quite traditional in certain aspects. It was not surprising that he was upset that his mistake had caused such a commotion. The bedroom was dark, only faintly lit. He was so focused on finding a good angle that he did not pay attention to anything else.\n\nHuo Zheng leaned down and kissed Lin Xiaowan before he said teasingly in a low voice, \u201cIt\u2019s your fault.\u201d\nAfter the photo was deleted, the discussion continued for a while. There were also conspiracy theories about the drama of the rich and powerful, but no one paid attention to them. All the malicious comments were also quickly dealt with.\nIn a blink of an eye, it was already close to the lunar new year. According to Shengjing\u2019s customs, this was the beginning of the new year. It was also the time when families reunite.\nAfter waking up in the morning, Lin Xiaowan packed up before she brought Little Paste back to the old residence.\nThe Huo family\u2019s old residence was big. It was not difficult to find a spacious room for Little Chestnut there. She had previously informed the housekeeper that she would be bringing Little Chestnut so a room had already been prepared for Little Chestnut.\nPreviously, Huo Dabao and Huo Erbao had gone abroad for a winter camp after their vacation. They had just returned the day for the lunar new year. When the two little children met Little Chestnut for the first time, they were extremely excited and clamored to play with it.\nLittle Chestnut had always been reserved and introverted. Moreover, this was also the first time it met the two children. It could not withstand the children\u2019s enthusiasm and quickly meowed, pouncing into Lin Xiaowan\u2019s arms and burying its head in her arms like a frightened child.\nLin Xiaowan gave the children cat treats as she said, \u201cI\u2019ll give you her favorite treat. She\u2019s very easy to bribe with food. Once she\u2019s gotten familiar with you, you\u2019ll be able to play with her.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan looked down at the cat in her arms. She was not too worried since it seemed to be in a good state.\nHuo Dabao and Huo Erbao were very experienced in dealing with small animals. They lay on the ground, looking like caterpillars as they tried to bribe Little Chestnut with food. After a while, when Little Chestnut looked more comfortable, they tried to touch its fur and its little paws with their small hands.\nHuo Dabao, who was touching Little Chestnut\u2019s paw, asked curiously, \u201cAunt, Little Chestnut is so big. What kind of cat is she? I have never seen such a huge cat\u2026\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a stray cat. As for its size\u2026. Maybe it\u2019s just growing?\u201d Lin Xiaowan said, looking uncertain when she spoke.\nIn fact, she was also confused about Little Chestnut\u2019s size. Little Chestnut\u2019s mother\u2019s size was normal. In fact, after a bath, it even looked a little small.\nLittle Chestnut had enough exercise, and its diet was also just right. A physical examination also showed that there was nothing wrong with its health. It was not fat, but its size was really quite big. At that time, it was already almost twice the size of its mother.\nIn the end, Lin Xiaowan, who was puzzled, brought Little Chestnut to the Animal Rescue Association to ask about the growth of Little Chestnut\u2019s siblings..\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

Although the other siblings\u2019 sizes were not out of the ordinary, there was one that was bigger than ordinary cats just like Little Chestnut.\nAt that time, the vet examined Little Chestnut and concluded that it probably carried some genes of the Maine Coon based on its ears\u2019 shape, claws, and fur.\nLin Xiaowan did not care about this. In any case, there were all cats. As long as Little Chestnut was healthy, it did nor matter.\nMeanwhile, with rhe treat in hand, the children finally won Little Chestnut s favor, and they soon became familiar with each other.\nAfter staying for two days in the Huo family\u2019s old residence, Lin Xiaowan decided to stream the daily life of Little Chestnut again.\nHowever, due to the exposure of her identity, her account on Bobo Star had gained a lot of followers. It was no longer as simple as before. She decided that she would continue to broadcast occasionally. If people wanted to look ar Little Chestnut, they would be able to look at it. If not, it did nor matter to her. It was not like she was relying on this to feed herself.\nSimilar to before, Lin Xiaowan used her phone for the live broadcast.\nLittle Chestnut\u2019s designated room in the old residence was huge. There was a floor-to-ceiling window that allowed sunlight to stream into the room, and it was meticulously decorated. Even the area where rhe cat litter was placed looked more like a small indoor landscape than a cat toilet.\nThere was also a custom-made cat tree and a running wheel in the room so Little Chestnut could play. There were even plants in the room to purify the air.\nNeedless to say, the room had also been safety-proofed so there would be no hidden danger.\nAll in all, the room was very suitable for live broadcasting.\nHuo Dabao and Huo Erbao had heard about this from Lin Xiaowan previously, and they were familiar with the term live broadcast\u2019.\n\u2018I know what\u2019s a live broadcast! You can show others what you\u2019re doing live through a platform!\u201d Huo Dabao said at that time, showing off his knowledge.\n\u201cYou\u2019re so smart,\u201d Lin Xiaowan said with a smile, \u201cThere are many people on the Internet who like Little Chestnut and want to know how she\u2019s doing. That\u2019s why I\u2019m doing this. However, 1\u201911 have to be careful not to show your faces if you\u2019re around\u2026\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay! It doesn\u2019t matter if our faces are shown,\u201d Huo Erbao said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Huo Dabao chimed in, \u201cMom often rakes photos and videos of us. We\u2019re used to it.\u201d\nNeedless to say, Qiao You\u2019an would not turn on a live broadcast of her children. The videos and photos she took were to record the children s lives and growth. Occasionally, she would let the children video call their grandparents who missed them.\nLin Xiaowan smiled and nodded. \u201cAlright.\u201d\nNaturally, she was just being perfunctory. She knew it would not be good to expose Huo Dabao and Huo Erbao s faces in front of the camera. After all, Huo Cheng\u2019s identity was special, and the Huo family had always valued privacy\nLin Xiaowan did not notify anyone that she was going to start a live broadcast. She woke up after a nap and made the decision on a whim. She also waited when the two children were asleep to do a live broadcast. With this, she did not have to worry about the two children being caught on camera.\nAs usual, when the live broadcast started, there were nor many people.\nLin Xiaowan sat on a beanbag in the middle of the room, looking as though she was boneless as she held her phone.\nWhen rhe live broadcast started, a notification would be sent to the followers with the title of the live broadcast at the top. Apart from that, Bobo Star would also recommend the live broadcast to other users based on the data it collected.\nNeedless to say, it did not take long before the viewers flooded the comment section with their comments.\n[Netizen #1: Oh my gosh! Finally, a live broadcast!\u201d\n(Netizen #2:1 get to see what the little darling is doing again! \u201d\n[Netizen #3: Is it my imagination, or has she grown again?]\n[Netizen #4: Does it really have its own room? ]\n[Netizen #5: Sigh, a cat has a better life than me\u2026]\n[Netizen #6: The room is amazing.

Don\u2019t think about anything else. ]\nI Lin Xiaowan: I didn\u2019t decorate this room. 1 brought Little Chestnut here for the lunar new year. 1 was surprised as well when I saw the room ]\nThe number of viewers was much higher than before. With more people watching the live broadcast, Bobo Star would recommend it more to other users. There were even people who gave gifts during the live broadcast.\nThere were still people asking Lin Xiaowan to show her face, but most people chose to ignore them.\nLin Xiaowan also stopped responding to the comments. She was focused on Little Chestnut.\n[Netizen #1: Hahaha, there\u2019s nothing for Little Chestnut to break here!]\n[Netizen #2: Indeed, indeed! This room is very cat-friendly! I\nSeeing this, Lin Xiaowan felt the need to clarify.\nI Lin Xiaowan: Its not Little Chestnut\u2019s fault. After all, those things were out in the open. Little Chestnut is usually very obedient.]\nAt this time, Huo Dabao and Huo Erbao suddenly came into the room. They heard the noises and ran over to look for Little Chestnut. Their newly established friendship with the cat was very strong.\nLin Xiaowan lowered the camera a little. Despite rhe children saying it did not matter, it was better to pay attention to the children\u2019s privacy.\nUnsurprisingly, the viewers were curious about the two children. Although they could not see the duo\u2019s faces, they could hear rhe cute voices and see the duo\u2019s cute and furry pajamas,\n[Netizen #1: Two cute dumplings! Who are they?

They came to play with Little Chestnut.]\nAfter that, Lin Xiaowan ignored the subsequent strange comments.\nNot long after that, she ended the live broadcast. She did not live broadcast very often, and each time, the duration was not very long. Under normal circumstances, it would not exceed two hours.\nThe viewers were already used to Lin Xiaowan\u2019s behavior so they did not think much of this. They also knew that she would only occasionally reply to the comments, and most of the time, they were related to Little Chestnut.\nClose to the lunar new year, the fantasy drama Gu Yuwu invested in also began airing. It did not take long before it became popular.\nIn the beginning, Lin Xiaowan was unaware that the drama had started airing. When she was watching television with Huo Dabao and Huo Erbao, she came across an advertisement for the drama. She only found out about it after she spoke to Gu Yuwu.\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me it started airing!\u201d Lin Xiaowan said, feigning a shocked and hurt tone.\nGu Yuwu laughed. \u201cI told you about it previously! 1 said that it\u2019d begin to air somewhere in January. Look at the calendar. When it started airing, it was the first weekend of January.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan rarely watched dramas so she had indeed forgotten about this matter. As such, she could only give up her act. She said, \u201cIt aired so quickly. 12 episodes have been aired so far. Doesn\u2019t this mean it won\u2019t be long until the finale airs?\u201d\nGu Yuwu did some calculations before she replied, \u201c1 guess. Six episodes are aired every week. It\u2019ll take about a month for the drama to complete airing. You should be able to see yourself on TV in another two weeks.\u201d\nAfter two weeks, It would be the end of the lunar new year and the start of the Lantern Festival.\n\nDuring this time, Lin Xiaowan also received a confirmation e-mail and a phone call from the Venus Hope Competition, informing her that her artwork had passed the first round of selection and that they were now in the second round of selection.\nMany artworks had passed the first round of selection since the first round was based on the public\u2019s votes on the Venus Hope Competition\u2019s official website.\nAfter Lin Xiaowan was notified of this, she logged onto the website. She was shocked when she saw her artwork was actually ranked quite high. Initially, she did not have any expectations for the competition. However, after seeing this ranking, her heart could not help but give birth to some expectations.\nSince the first round was based on the public\u2019s vote, Lin Xiaowan thought that her painting happened to match the public\u2019s preferences.\nIt was a little late when Huo Zheng returned from work. His annual leave for the lunar new year would officially begin today.\nWhen he entered the huge suite-like bedroom in the old residence, he walked past the small living room and made his way to the bedroom. When he saw the warm light from the bedside lamp, he knew that Lin Xiaowan was still awake.\nLin Xiaowan quickly ran toward him when she saw him.\n\u201cYou\u2019re back!\u201d\nHuo Zheng reached out and pinched her cheek, saying, \u201cStaying up late again? It\u2019s almost midnight.\u201d\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t sleep. I wanted to wait for you to come back.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\nHuo Zheng knew that Lin Xiaowan usually stuck to her routine. When it was time, she would automatically feel sleepy. Unless something happened, it was rare that she could not fall asleep.\nAs expected, Lin Xiaowan nodded and said, \u201cYes! 1 have something 1 want to share with you!\u201d\nHuo Zheng removed his coat and leaned against the headboard of the bed with her in his arms. Seeing the excitement on Lin Xiaowan\u2019s face, he asked curiously, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan showed him the e-mail from the Venus Hope Competition on her phone and said, \u201cLook! My artwork passed the first round of selection!\u201d\n\nThen, she opened the official website and showed him the popularity rankings as she said, \u201cI\u2019m ranked 17th!\u201d\nHuo Zheng had seen her artwork before she submitted it. However, he still looked at her artwork, which was displayed on the website, carefully. His expression was also serious as he read the comments below it. After that, he said sincerely, \u201cQingqing, you\u2019re really amazing. You only started taking lessons not long ago, but you already managed to pass the first round of selection of a competition. You\u2019ll definitely be even more amazing in the future.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan was very pleased with Huo Zheng\u2019s attitude. He was not perfunctory at all. He listened to her attentively, and his words were also sincere. Satisfied with the praise, she said, \u201cAlright, go and take a shower. I\u2019ll wait for you.\u201d\nThen, she hid under the blanket and waited until Huo Zheng came to bed before she went to sleep.\nIn the morning, the weather was not very good. It was gloomy. The weather forecast said that it was going to snow.\nLin Xiaowan and the two children helped the butler paste auspicious couplets and decorate the house.\nThe old residence occupied a huge expanse of land. There were several small houses in the compound, and there was also a small hall that was used to honor their ancestors. Asphalt roads snaked around the compound, leading to various buildings in the compound.\nThe compound was also decorated with festive red lanterns.\nAt six, the chefs began to cook. Before this, the chef had submitted the dinner menu, and it was approved by Qiao You\u2019an. There were all kinds of dishes: sweet, sour, salty, and spicy. Just cold dishes alone, they had four. Fortunately, although there were many dishes, their portions were small.\nThe Huo family was quite traditional. After dinner, they would watch the Spring Festival Gala on television after dinner.\nThe employees who chose to work instead of going home for the holidays would also eat at this time and celebrate the lunar new year in their living quarters. It was rather lively as well.\nAt some point, Huo Cheng went to the wine cellar and brought out a bottle of wine that he had obtained from an auction. He said that he had treasured it a lot and could not bear to drink it before this.\nLin Xiaowan wanted to try the wine, but she only got a small sip from Huo Zheng\u2019s wine glass. In the end, she was given a class of fizzy cola. Based on this, it could be seen that her treatment was similar to that of Huo Dabao and Huo Erbao.\nAt this time, Qiao You\u2019an was holding her wine glass and looking at Lin Xiaowan who was sitting next to her two sons. Seeing how well they got along, her gaze was gentle and affectionate.\n\u201cThis is the first time Xiaowan is officially celebrating the lunar new year with our family. In the future, there\u2019ll be one more person in our family\u2026\u201d\u2018\nThis might be the case for Qiao You\u2019an, but for Lin Xiaowan, who had been reborn, this was definitely not the case.

She was not sure how much he remembered of the past, but now, it was no longer important to her. Her memories from this life were slowly replacing those from the past.\nShe leaned over to Huo Zheng and said, \u201cI want another sip.\u201d\nHuo Zheng looked at Lin Xiaowan who was acting coquettishly. Although his voice was gentle, it was firm as well as he said, \u201cYou\u2019ve already agreed that you\u2019d only take one sip. You already had a sip earlier.\u201d\nThe atmosphere was very casual. They chatted as they ate and drank just like an ordinary family.\nAfter a while, Huo Cheng suddenly said, \u201cSince both of you are engaged, we should hold a banquet so no one will speculate and create rumors\u2026\u201d\nQiao You\u2019an had almost forgotten about this matter. She knew Huo Zheng and Lin Xiaowan had gone to see the meteor shower a while ago. She had also seen their rings so there was no need to ask too much. She only needed to take a look at Huo Zheng to obtain the answer. When she heard her husband\u2019s words, she nodded and said, \u201cThat\u2019s right. Now that Huo Zheng has a ring on his finger, even if others don\u2019t take the initiative to ask, they also know what\u2019s happening\u2026\u201d\nSeeing the hesitant expression on Lin Xiaowan\u2019s face, Qiao You\u2019an said, \u201cIt\u2019s fine if you don\u2019t want a huge banquet. We\u2019ll just hold a small banquet after the new year. We can\u2019t let outsiders speculate about this matter. It won\u2019t be good for your reputation.\u201d\nQiao You\u2019an was sincerely thinking on Lin Xiaowan\u2019s behalf. In her opinion, if Lin Xiaowan was willing, it would be better if Lin Xiaowan could marry Huo Zheng immediately.\n\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Lin Xiaowan asked Huo Zheng. She was no longer very resistant to such things, but she was still a little uncomfortable when she thought about how everyone would stare at her as though she was a rare animal.\nHuo Zheng thought about it for a moment before he said, \u201cI want to make this public and official so others won\u2019t talk or speculate about you.\u201d\n\nDue to the power and status of the Huo family, all their movements were subjected to public scrutiny. In Huo Zheng\u2019s opinion, if he did not make things clear, it would only make people gossip more.\nLin Xiaowan\u2019s background was ordinary; she was not from an aristocratic family. It was inevitable that people would gossip about the difference in their status and background. Huo Zheng naturally did not want her to be subjected to malicious speculations.\nLin Xiaowan thought about it for a moment before asking, \u201cWhat will the engagement banquet be like?\u201d\nQiao You\u2019an replied, \u201cThere won\u2019t be a lot of people. Just some friends. The media won\u2019t be present.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan nodded in agreement. \u201cIt\u2019s fine as long as it\u2019s not too grand. We\u2019ll do as you said then, Sister-in-law. We can announce it officially during the banquet. We\u2019ll discuss the rest later.\u201d\nDinner lasted until past nine. After that, Huo Zheng, Lin Xiaowan, and the two children set off fireworks in the courtyard.\nHuo Cheng, who was usually in charge of the entertainment during the lunar new year, had bought a lot of fireworks.\nLin Xiaowan and the two children huddled together while Huo Zheng lit the fireworks.\nAfter lighting them, Huo Zheng ran back and pulled Lin Xiaowan into his arms.\nLin Xiaowan liked looking at beautiful things like this. The fireworks Huo Cheng bought were very unique and much more beautiful than the ones she had seen. She raised her phone and recorded a short video before posting it on Speaker.\nAlthough it was the eve of the lunar new year, everyone seemed to be on their phones. Not long after Lin Xiaowan posted, many comments came pouring in. All sorts of people gathered in her comment section and started another round of discussion.\nAfter midnight, Lin Xiaowan climbed into bed and looked at the comments.\n[Netizen #1: Doesn\u2019t Shengjing\u2019s policy forbid fireworks? How dare you light fireworks so openly? You haven\u2019t even married into a wealthy family yet, but you\u2019re already showing off! I\u2019m going to report this!]\nMany people replied to this comment. Some agreed, some disagreed, and some were only curious.\n\nLin Xiaowan was aware of Shengjing\u2019s fireworks policy. However, fireworks were only prohibited in the city center. The Huo family\u2019s old residence was miles and miles away from the city center so it was not illegal to set off fireworks.\n[Lin Xiaowan: Shengjing only banned fireworks in the city center. We\u2019re in the suburbs so it\u2019s fine.]\nThe other party seemed to be paying close attention to the comment section. As soon as Lin Xiaowan replied, the other party\u2019s reply came almost immediately.\n[Netizen #1: Let alone Shengjing, in the entire Shangxia, who doesn\u2019t know the Huo family? The Huo family is so rich, how can they live on the outskirts of the city? Who are you trying to lie to?]\n[Lin Xiaowan: Are you okay? What\u2019s wrong with living on the outskirts? Moreover, did you buy the house? Am I staying in your house?]\nLin Xiaowan\u2019s reaction now was much better than before after reading so many comments.\nMany people laughed when they read her comment. Only a few people acted in an extreme manner. As for those who also lived in Shengjing, seeing that the other party was so stubborn, they also spoke up for Lin Xiaowan.\n[Netizen #1: I\u2019m speechless. Why can\u2019t rich people live on the outskirts of the city? They can live wherever they want. The older generation in Shengjing lived on the outskirts of the city. It\u2019s normal to spend the lunar new year there. What\u2019s so hard to understand?]\n[Netizen #2: I\u2019m dying of laughter. It\u2019s just past midnight, but there are already all sorts of comments\u2026]\nAfter thinking about it for a moment, Lin Xiaowan clicked on the profile of the other person who was very persistent in finding fault with her. The account was created a while ago, but there was no information or post at all. Clearly, the other party really hated her or the Huo family.\nTo be on the safe side, Lin Xiaowan waited for Huo Zheng to finish washing up before she spoke to him about this matter.\nHuo Zheng looked at the comments and was not worried at all.\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I\u2019ll get someone to check the account later.\u201d\nThen, he took the phone away and said, \u201cDon\u2019t look at it anymore. Let\u2019s go to sleep.\u201d\n\u201cBut, 1 don\u2019t usually stay up late. It\u2019s almost 1 AM now, but I\u2019m not sleepy at all. Moreover, 1 ate so much earlier\u2026\u201d Lin Xiaowan said softly.\nHuo Zheng was helpless when faced with her. In the end, he silently passed her a digestive pill..\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

After dinner, she continued eating snacks until it was time to brush her teeth. After eating so much, it was not strange that she felt bloated.\nHuo Zheng held her in his arms and gently rubbed her stomach with his warm hand. He asked, \u201cStill not sleepy?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan was indeed very energetic. She did not even yawn once. She nodded and said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you read to me like you do at home?\u201d\nHuo Zheng\u2019s voice was very pleasing to the ears. His voice was steady and calm when he read. Although he usually read foreign and financial books and Lin Xiaowan did not understand anything, she found his voice soothing.\nHuo Zheng laughed softly when he heard her. He said, \u201cAt this time, there\u2019s a better way for you to fall asleep compared to that.\u201d\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan was full and lazy so her reaction was a little slow. She only reacted when Huo Zheng\u2019s hand on her stomach slid across her waist. She shivered immediately. She glanced at the clock before she said, \u201cIt\u2019s already 1 AM\u2026\u201d\nShe knew Huo Zheng really well. If she followed his wish now, she definitely would not be able to wake up in the morning.\nHuo Zheng moved his hand to the back of her neck and raised her head before he leaned down to kiss her. Then, he said, coaxing her, \u201cIt\u2019s fine. We don\u2019t have to wake up early tomorrow. We don\u2019t have to visit anyone either\u2026\u201d\nLin Xiaowan hesitated for a moment before she gave in to him.\nIt had been a while since the duo had any intimate time. Huo Zheng managed a huge corporation, and it was only normal that he was extremely busy, especially before the holidays. He woke up early every day and came home late. He would fall asleep in seconds after getting into bed.\nIn short, Lin Xiaowan did not have any reason to refuse him, and it did not take long before she could no longer think about anything else.\nOn the first day of the lunar new year.\n\nWhen Lin Xiaowan woke up, she thought that it was dawn. However, when she glanced at the clock, she discovered that it was already past two in the afternoon.\nLin Xiaowan was still very groggy. The curtains in the room were drawn so the room was only faintly lit. It was snowing outside so the sky was dark as well, making the room even darker.\nShe did not know what kind of medicine Huo Zheng had taken last night, but he was very energetic. Perhaps it was just because they had not been intimate for a long time. In the end, she had to plead for mercy. She was so tired when it ended that she did not even know when she fell asleep.\nAlthough it was past 2 PM, she still felt a little sleepy. However, she was not hungry. When she was half-awake in the morning, Huo Zheng had fed her something. She smacked her lips. She had no impression of what she had eaten at all.\nLin Xiaowan got up and fumbled around for her phone. Before sleeping, Huo Zheng would usually place her phone far away, afraid that it would disturb her.\nShe pulled the curtains to the side and found her phone on the shelf.\nOutside the window, huge snowflakes fell from the sky. It had been snowing for a while so there was a thick layer of snow on the ground.\nLin Xiaowan took her phone from the shelf and looked at it. There were a few new year\u2019s greetings from the filming crew, and there was also a message from Gu Yuwu asking where she was and if she was doing anything today. Cheng Ruitong also sent her a personal message, and she made a note to reply to the other party.\nQiao You\u2019an also sent a message.\n[Qiao You\u2019an: Xiaowan, when you wake up, eat the warm soup and porridge we left for you in the kitchen. There are also dumplings we made in the morning, yellow rice cakes, and glutinous rice balls. The chef is working today. Just tell him to prepare those things for you. Just treat this as your home. Don\u2019t be shy.]\n[Qiao You\u2019an: I\u2019ve already told Huo Zheng about this, but 1 was worried he\u2019d forget about it so I decided to remind you. We\u2019ve gone out with Dabao and Erbao so there\u2019s no one at home. Don\u2019t be afraid. We\u2019ll be back in the afternoon.]\nLin Xiaowan could not help but smile when she saw how Qiao You\u2019an treated her like a child.\nWhen Lin Xiaowan went to change, she was stunned when she saw herself in the mirror. She did not feel it last night, but there was a particularly distinct handprint on her waist. When she saw it, she could not help but curse at Huo Zheng inwardly.\nAfter she changed, Huo Zheng entered the room and hugged her.\n\u201cYou\u2019re awake.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan originally planned to complain about his behavior last night, but when she looked at him, her words were stuck in her throat. This was because she had seen the huge bite mark on his chin. She looked away guiltily, trying to pretend she did not see it.\n\nHuo Zheng did not let her get away with it. He held her waist and asked, \u201cDid you see it? This is evidence of your evil deed\u2026\u201d\n\u2018Look at how he\u2019s complaining first!\u2019\nLin Xiaowan stepped on his foot and glared at him. \u201cHow dare you talk nonsense? Who committed evil deeds?\u201d\nAlas, her voice was soft, and she looked harmless. Huo Zheng was even more amused when he heard her words. After helping her put on her slippers, he carried her to the kitchen downstairs.\nThe Huo family\u2019s old residence was big so there were always employees around all year round. The difference was whether there were more or fewer people depending on the occasion.\nLin Xiaowan, who was being carried, was embarrassed and blushed when she saw the employees.\n\u201cLet me down. 1 can walk.\u201d\nHuo Zheng did not let her go. He did not even pause and carried her straight to the dining room.\n\u201cDon\u2019t be shy. Brother and Sister-in-law often do this. They\u2019re used to it.\u201d\nWhile Lin Xiaowan was eating, Huo Zheng gave her a red packet. This was not the first time she received a red packet from him. He had given her one last year as well. Instead of cash, her red packet contained a card.\n\u201cThank you, Brother. You\u2019re the best,\u201d Lin Xiaowan said coquettishly.\nSeeing that there was no one in the dining room, Huo Zheng leaned over and kissed her. After that, he did not let her go. Instead, he pulled her over onto his lap and hugged her as she continued to eat.\nAfter the meal, Huo Zheng showed Lin Xiaowan the interior design for the house in Xilin Imperial Garden, which was being renovated. The design was simple with muted colors. At this time, it was only equipped with basic furniture and appliances. There was no need for major renovations, and they only needed to decorate the house and buy furniture.\nLin Xiaowan did not need to do much. She only needed to look at the designs to see if she liked them.\nA week later, Lin Xiaowan received a notification from the Venus Hope Competition, informing her that she had advanced to the next round again.\nShe was playing with Little Chestnut when she received the call. She was a little shocked when she heard about it.\n\u201cI managed to advance to the next round again? How many rounds are there in total?\u201d\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

We\u2019ve officially invited experts in the art world to judge the artworks. The final results will be out after that.\u201d\n\u201cI called you not only to announce your advancement to the next round, but to also inform you that the final round will be conducted live. The judging and the scores will be completely transparent to be fair. Do you have time to come to the venue?\u201d the other party said before informing Lin Xiaowan about the time and location.\nThe venue was the studio of Shengjing Broadcasting Tower.\nLin Xiaowan thought about it for a moment. She said, not in a hurry to confirm her attendance, \u201c1 can\u2019t confirm it now. Can 1 let you know at a later date?\u201d\n\u201cAlright. We\u2019ll send you an e-invitation later. At that time, you can confirm your attendance. We\u2019ll also have someone send you a physical invitation, the other party said, \u201cOh, right, you can also bring your family and friends. Just fill in the number of people you plan to bring at the bottom of the invitation before sending it back to us. However, the maximum number of people you can bring is only three.\u201d\nAfter the call ended, Lin Xiaowan quickly checked her e-mail. The Venus Hope Competition\u2019s invitation for the finals was already in her inbox.\nWhen Huo Zheng returned, Lin Xiaowan ran over impatiently.\n\u201cHuo Zheng!\u201d\nHuo Zheng opened his arms and hugged her tightly. Then, he tapped her forehead lightly as he said, \u201cYou didn\u2019t wear your house slippers again.\u201d\nIt was not too bad if they were at home, but there was no floor heating in the old residence. She would get cold whenever she walked around barefooted, but she never learned her lesson.\n\u201cLet me tell you something,\u201d Lin Xiaowan said, showing him the e-mail, \u201cLook, I advanced to the next round again. A staff member of the Venus Hope Competition called me today and asked if 1 could attend the final round.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s amazing,\u201d Huo Zheng said. After taking a seat on the couch with Lin Xiaowan in his arms, he read the e-mail and said, \u201cWe don\u2019t have much to do that day. Do you want to go?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve seen the other participants\u2019 artworks. 1 don\u2019t think I\u2019ll win. It feels like there\u2019s no point in going\u2026\u201d Then, she asked curiously, \u201cWhat will it be like?\u201d\n\u201cThe judges will probably comment on the artworks since you said it\u2019ll be broadcasted live. They\u2019ll likely show the artworks along with the artists. If you don\u2019t like it, then don\u2019t go,\u201d Huo Zheng said.\nWhen Lin Xiaowan was reminded that it would be broadcasted live, she no longer wanted to go. \u201cThat\u2019s right. They\u2019ll definitely show the participants. I think 1 won\u2019t go.\u201d\nThere might be quite a number of people watching the live broadcast. Not many people might know her name, but her face had become quite recognizable. She did not like appearing in front of the camera.\nAfter that, Lin Xiaowan typed out a short and polite reply before she declined the invitation.\nLin Xiaowan and Huo Zheng still had to wait for a while before they could move into the house in Xilin Imperial Garden. For this reason, they had been staying in the old residence for this period of time. She spent her days playing with Little Chestnut along with Huo Dabao and Huo Erbao.\nThe Lantern Festival was in two days.\nThe two children were given a task to complete during their winter vacation. They decided to make dumplings. As long as they took photos and wrote in their diary, this homework would be considered completed.\nLin Xiaowan recalled the years when her grandfather was still alive. Due to his weak digestive ability, he would mix millet flour with a little glutinous flour and brown sugar to make brown sugar glutinous balls. They were not very sweet, and the skin was soft. It might not be as delicious as ordinary glutinous balls, but the taste is very unique. She asked tentatively if she could make them.\nQiao You\u2019an readily agreed and prepared the ingredients for Lin Xiaowan.\nOn the day of the Lanter Festival, Huo Zheng decided to work from home. When everyone was done with their work, they gathered to do this \u2018homework\u2019 together.\nWhile they were chatting, Qiao You\u2019an mentioned the engagement banquet.\nShe said, \u201cWhen spring arrives, you should attend Fashion Week with me. It\u2019s a good chance for you to look at new clothes. We need new clothes for the engagement banquet after all. You can pick the ones you like first. After all, it\u2019ll take a while for them to send the clothes over.\u201d\n\nLin Xiaowan could not find the recipe for the glutinous balls her grandfather made so she decided to go with her instincts. At this moment, she was filling a mixing bowl with water to make the dough. When she heard Qiao You\u2019an\u2019s words, she paused for a moment. She said, \u201cDon\u2019t we usually have banquets after the Lantern Festival? There\u2019s no need to deliberately organize an engagement banquet. We can just announce it during one of those banquets.\u201d\n\u201cYou have to have an engagement banquet. We can\u2019t do it so casually,\u201d Qiao You\u2019an said, worried that Lin Xiaowan would be wronged.\nLin Xiaowan did not pay much attention to this matter. In her mind, this was just a small matter. She said softly with a hint of pleading, \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to, Sister-in-law. I don\u2019t think it needs to be so grand. We can just simply announce it.\u201d\nQiao You\u2019an found it hard to refuse Lin Xiaowan so she turned to glare at Huo Zheng. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you making a sound?\u201d\nHuo Zheng helped Lin Xiaowan wipe off the flour on her hand. He did not seem to mind his sister-in-law pushing the matter to him. He said, \u201cLet\u2019s just do what Qingqing wants.\u201d\nQiao You\u2019an felt a little helpless when she heard this. Regarding matters like this, Huo Zheng usually followed Lin Xiaowan\u2019s wish. As for Huo Cheng, she knew she would not be able to help her in this matter.\nQiao You\u2019an thought about it for a moment. In the end, she could only say, \u201cLet\u2019s just get this matter done when spring comes. Don\u2019t delay this matter.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan nodded in agreement.\nFor wealthy families, an engagement or marriage was not so simple. There might be other factors involved such as their families\u2019 interests and the like. However, Lin Xiaowan was alone. In her opinion, there was no need for her to have a grand engagement banquet.\nThe Sunday after the Lantern Festival was the final round of the Venus Hope Competition. The artworks that made it passed the first two rounds would be evaluated on the spot that day.\nThe event would start at 10 AM.\nLin Xiaowan clicked on the link to the live broadcast that was posted on the Venus Hope Competition\u2019s official website.\nThe official website had a list of the artworks that had advanced to the final round. In total, there were 30 artworks. Lin Xiaowan was ranked 17th so she figured that her artwork would be evaluated sometime in the afternoon.\nIn the venue, apart from the judges and the participants, there was also the audience. Although their number was not high, there were still at least 100 of them..\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

The camera would then pan to those who were present.\nUpon seeing this, Lin Xiaowan sighed in relief, thinking that it was a good thing that she decided not to go. Moreover, there were cameras everywhere in the studio. She knew how observant the netizens were. If she appeared on camera, there was a chance they would discover the video and make the connections again.\nThe judges\u2019 evaluations were naturally very helpful. However, after listening for a while, Lin Xiaowan was confused by the professional terms they used.\nAt this time, Lin Xiaowan\u2019s phone suddenly rang. She thought it was Huo Zheng since he knew today was the final round of the Venue Hope Competition. However, she soon discovered it was Hong Minhua, whom she had not seen in half a month.\n\u201cHappy new year, Grandma Hong,\u201d Lin Xiaowan said softly as soon as she answered the call.\nHong Minhua chuckled and said, \u201cHappy new year! When are you coming back from the Huo family\u2019s old residence? I\u2019ll give you a red packet when our lessons resume.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, we\u2019ll be coming back soon,\u201d Lin Xiaowan said. Then, she asked curiously, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Grandma Hong? Why did you suddenly call me?\u201d\n\u201cI saw the artwork you submitted for the Venus Hope Competition. Your painting is very good,\u201d Hong Minhua said with a smile. She was clearly satisfied with the artwork Lin Xiaowan submitted.\nLin Xiaowan tried to adhere to the principle of fairness as much as she could. Apart from showing her draft to Hong Minhua in the beginning and listening to the other party\u2019s suggestions for improvement, she did not ask for any help after that. The entire thing was completely her own creation.\nIt was her first time painting so many details. It was very different from her previous paintings of various sceneries and anthropomorphic characters.\nLin Xiaowan was satisfied with the artwork she submitted, but the feeling of being praised by Hong Minhua gave her a different feeling. After all, a professional praised her work. It was definitely something to be happy about. Even if she did not win, it did not matter.\nLin Xiaowan smiled and said sweetly, sounding a little shy, \u201cThank you for your praise, Grandma Hong.\u201d\n\nAfter praising Lin Xiaowan a few more times, Hong Minhua said, \u201cI\u2019ve seen the other works as well. Yours is very good. Although it\u2019s a little difficult to win the first prize, it\u2019s not impossible. In any case, whether you win or not, I hope you won\u2019t be discouraged or sad, okay?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan naturally did not care about this. \u201cGrandma Hong, I know. I don\u2019t worry.\u201d\nThere were a lot of participants, and many of them did not even pass the first round of selection. This was Lin Xiaowan\u2019s first time participating in the competition, even if it was not a professional competition, it was already impressive that she made it to the final round.\nAfter a short break in the middle of the show, the second half of the evaluation and scoring resumed.\nThe full marks were 10.\nThe judges\u2019 evaluation of Lin Xiaowan\u2019s artwork was quite positive, but they also mentioned many areas that needed improvement.\nLin Xiaowan listened attentively and agreed with them. Before the final score was announced, she could not help but feel nervous.\nThe judges gave their respective marks, and the full score was taken from the average.\nIn the end, Lin Xiaowan\u2019s artwork scored 8.647. Among the paintings that had been evaluated until now, her painting was ranked third. For now, the highest-scoring painting had a score of 9.724, which was close to the full score. The second painting scored 9.335. Lin Xiaowan, who was in third place now, was far behind the first two. This also meant that her current rank was very unstable. After all, there were still more than a dozen participants behind her who had yet to be evaluated. Not only that, but there was a person among them whose artwork Hong Minhua thought would get the highest score.\nNonetheless, Lin Xiaowan was very satisfied with her score. She returned to the official website to look at the awards that would be given, she found that in the worst-case scenario, she would still get a consolation prize.\nAfter looking at the list of awards, Lin Xiaowan felt sleepy. It did not take long before she leaned against the couch and fell asleep with a soft pillow in her arms.\nWhen the servants came over to change the tea, they tried their best not to disturb her sleep. One of them adjusted the heating for her and also covered her with a small blanket.\nLin Xiaowan was very friendly to the employees and spoke very sweetly to them. She was very easy to get along with and did not put on airs. As such, most of the employees had a good impression of her and liked her a lot.\nLin Xiaowan was woken up by a phone call. She wokeup in a daze, thinking it was the alarm. It took a while before she realized that it was a call from Huo Zheng.\nShe asked sleepily, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Why did you call me?\u201d\n\nHuo Zheng chuckled. He did not expect her to be sleeping at this time. \u201cQingqing, were you sleeping?\u201d\n\u201cHmm, no, I\u2019m watching the final round of the competition\u2026\u201d Lin Xiaowan said, but when she looked at the huge screen in front of her, she exclaimed in surprise, \u201cEh? It\u2019s already over!\u201d\nHuo Zheng could not help but laugh seeing how muddle-headed she was, thinking that she was really cute. \u201cYou even fell asleep watching your own competition?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan said, embarrassed, \u201c1 didn\u2019t expect it as well\u2026\u201d\nLin Xiaowan wondered how she fared in the end. In any case, she was sure she would at least win the consolation prize. Perhaps due to her certainty, she was not nervous at all and fell asleep.\n\u201cQingqing, you\u2019re really amazing. Not only did you get fifth place, but you also won the Most Creative award in the competition.\u201d\n\u201cHuh?\u201d\n\u20181 managed to place fifth?\u2019\nWhen she submitted her artwork, she also submitted a brief explanation of the inspiration behind her artwork. She had been inspired by Lin Qing, but for privacy reasons, she had omitted Lin Qing\u2019s name when she wrote about her inspiration.\n\u201cIt won\u2019t be long before you\u2019ll be able to win the grand prize. You\u2019re the best. It seems like I\u2019ll have to think about how I can reward you,\u201d Huo Zheng said before asking, \u201cDo you want to open a studio?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan refused him immediately. \u201cNo, that\u2019s so troublesome! Painting is a hobby for me. I won\u2019t feel like painting anymore if it feels like work. It\u2019ll be boring.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, okay. Since you have your own ideas and opinions about this, I can only think of another reward.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan looked at the time and asked, \u201cWere you watching the live broadcast in the office?\u201d\n\u201cI only watched your part and the ceremony at the end,\u201d Huo Zheng replied truthfully. He laughed as he continued to say, \u201cI couldn\u2019t wait to call you after I saw the results. I didn\u2019t expect to wake you up from your sleep.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan scrunched up her small nose before she said, \u201cYou\u2019re the boss, but you\u2019re setting a bad example for your employees. You actually slacked off at work.\u201d\n\u201cYour matters are more important than this\u2026\u201d\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

After the live broadcast ended, the winners were also listed on the website. Apart from that, the mysterious prize for the winner was also revealed. It was a paid family trip abroad, which included air tickets, accommodations, and expenses. A tour guide and interpreter would also accompany them during the trip. It would definitely be an enjoyable trip.\nLin Xiaowan looked at the person who placed first. As expected, it was the person whom Hong Minhua had mentioned earlier. The work was initially ranked 26th placed first with a score of 9.892.\nThe colors were bold, and the lines were delicate. The painting was vivid and neat. It was almost comparable to that of a professional. No one would expect that the artist was a deliveryman who loved painting. This proved that one could not judge a book by its cover.\nLin Xiaowan quickly received an e-mail from the Venus Hope Competition. After filling out the form, all she had to do was wait for the 10,000 yuan she won from the Most Creative award to arrive.\nA staff member of the Venus Hope Competition also called Lin Xiaowan to ask if they could put her artwork up for sale in the gallery. Naturally, the profits would go to the artist. This was advantageous to the participants since the paintings could be sold at a high price.\nNonetheless, Lin Xiaowan refused without taking much time to consider it. She wanted to frame the painting and give it to Lin Qing. It was also a form of support and affirmation for Lin Qing\u2019s choice of hobbies and life.\nThe time for the Huo family\u2019s banquet had been set.\nQiao You\u2019an invited Lin Xiaowan to fly overseas with her to attend Fashion Week before that. She planned to buy a few dresses for Lin Xiaowan.\n\nAfter announcing their engagement, Lin Xiaowan and Huo Zheng would move into their new home in Xilin Imperial Garden.\nLin Xiaowan\u2019s award-winning artwork had been entrusted to Huo Zheng. He had asked someone to choose a good wooden frame for it.\nTwo days before Lin Xiaowan left for Fashion Week with Qiao You\u2019an, Lin Xiaowan\u2019s character in the fantasy drama suddenly gained some popularity.\nAt this time, there were only a few episodes left. It was finally revealed that Lin Xiaowan\u2019s character was the mastermind behind the scenes. Interestingly, the character had always been cursed at, but after her appearance, her image seemed to have improved.\nLin Xiaowan nestled in Huo Zheng\u2019s arms as she watched the drama with him in the home theater.\nAlthough Huo Zheng did not know the full plot, he had briefly flipped through the script before. After all, he had helped Lin Xiaowan rehearse previously so he had some impression of it.\nHe stroked her cheek with his thumb as he said, \u201cYou look very beautiful, and your acting is good as well. Do you like acting?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan rolled her eyes. \u201cWhat acting? I only sat there and said a few words. Moreover, 1 only appeared for a few minutes\u2026\u201d\nHuo Zheng smiled and did not respond to these words. Instead, he asked again, \u201cDo you like acting? If you do, 1 can get someone to find you a good role that won\u2019t be tiring\u2026\u201d\nLin Xiaowan thought about it for a moment. She felt that it would be quite stressful to be under scrutiny all the time, especially when the cameras were constantly trained on her. Finally, she said, \u201cNo. I think it\u2019s very interesting to watch the filming process though. Perhaps when Sister Yuwu is filming again, 1\u201911 follow her to have a look.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, as long as you like it,\u201d Huo Zheng said. As long as she was happy, he did not have any objection.\nGu Yuwu sent a message to Lin Xiaowan. She was the one who told Lin Xiaowan that the goddess had become relatively popular. Since it was about 8 PM, she did not call, worried that she would disturb Lin Xiaowan\u2019s dinnertime.\n\nLin Xiaowan logged onto Speaker. When she filmed the character of the goddess, she had not been exposed yet. After attending the charity auction with Gu Yuwu, many people knew what she looked like. After the fantasy drama began airing, people began to speculate again.\nLin Xiaowan\u2019s latest update on Speaker was the list of winners of the Venus Hope Competition. Her name was listed as Xiaowan, without her surname. With so many pieces of evidence, it would only take a short time before some observant netizen pieced the puzzles together. As such, she took the initiative to say that she had participated in a competition. She wanted to write something since it was her first time participating in a competition and winning a prize. However, after thinking about it for a long time, she did not know what to say so she could only give up.\nWhether it was Huo Zheng, Qiao You\u2019an, Huo Cheng, Gu Yuwu, or Hong Minhua, the few people who were close to her had already praised her to the sky. With so much praise and encouragement, she could not help but overthink. She was worried that if she said too much on the Internet, people might misunderstand and think that she was showing off.\nAfter all, even the first person who won first prize did not even have a Speaker account. The second-prize winner only posted a short message to express his gratitude. With these two people as a comparison, Lin Xiaowan felt that she was too ostentatious.\nCurrently, a large number of people who had watched the latest episode flooded Lin Xiaowan\u2019s comment section.\n[Netizen #1: Wow! What kind of goddess is she? She even knows how to paint! How impressive!]\n[Netizen #2: Imagine this. There\u2019s no one in the divine realm except for the goddess. Imagine her holding her chin and painting in the divine realm because she\u2019s bored. It\u2019s a little cute, right?]\n[Netizen #3: She\u2019s so cute! The divine realm only has the goddess. Think about it, what else can she do but torment the main characters and toy with them?] [Netizen #4: Moreover, the goddess seemed to have seen the errors of her way in the end and saved everyone!]\n[Netizen #5: Don\u2019t you think her behavior is like that of a child who has been ignored and is only seeking attention?]\n[Netizen #6: The goddess looks so cute sitting there\u2026]\nLin Xiaowan read the comments with her mouth agape.\n\u2018Cute?\u2019\nShe recalled the goddess was supposed to be cold, ruthless, and decisive. Why did the goddess suddenly become cute? She wondered if her acting skills were that bad. However, no one said anything when she was filming. She was really puzzled when she thought about this..\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

Seeing that the public\u2019s response was very good, they released a few of the behind-the-scenes clips and Lin Xiaowan\u2019s voice acting.\nLin Xiaowan\u2019s voice was completely different from the character she played. Her voice was soft, to begin with, and she had no experience in voice acting. She sounded soft and slightly awlward when she said the lines, completely lacking the aura of a goddess. Instead, just like some comments said, she sounded more like a child who had been ignored and was seeking attention.\nMany people who left comments in Lin Xiaowan\u2019s comment section went to the drama\u2019s official account to discuss the plot and the characters. After all, the finale was coming up, and everyone was following the drama closely.\nIn comparison, Lin Xiaowan\u2019s participation in the Venus Hope Competition did not receive much attention. After all, it was just a local competition in Shengjing, and she did not even rank first. It naturally could not compare to a drama that was being aired nationally.\nA small number of comments did discuss the Venus Hope Competition. However, the number was so small that the comments about the fantasy drama easily drowned the comments\nQiao You\u2019an left the children behind and brought Lin Xiaowan with her for Fashion Week two days before it started.\nFashion Week was a grand event in the fashion world. Many people would attend it, and the media would be there taking pictures and interviewing people.\nLin Xiaowan and Qiao You\u2019an avoided the attention and entered through the back entrance. The show was from a foreign brand that had been around for a long time.\nLin Xiaowan knew a little about the brand. She had quite a lot of clothes from the brand in her wardrobe.\nThe brand had been around for hundreds of years, and in recent years, its clothes and accessories became even more popular.\nLin Xiaowan asked Qiao You\u2019an, \u201cSister-in-law, there\u2019s a celebrity couple behind us. Do you know them? I\u2019m certain the media will definitely take pictures of them. 1 heard their wedding will be held in a castle. Everyone said that the castle belongs to the actor. He\u2019s very rich.\u201d\nWhen Lin Xiaowan was gossiping, her accent from her hometown came out a little.\nQiao You\u2019an glanced at her and patted her head as she said, \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s that rich. It isn\u2019t that easy to earn money in the entertainment industry. Moreover, one\u2019s popularity in the industry can fall in just a blink of an eye.\u201d\n\nQiao You\u2019an knew a little about the castle wedding. The actress was quite ostentatious after all. She thought she was marrying into a rich family, but things were not as glamorous as they seemed. Moreover, the castle did not belong to the actor.\nLin Xiaowan nodded, only half-understanding as she said, \u201cBut 1 think it\u2019s quite easy to earn money in the entertainment industry. Just a movie can earn them tens of millions\u2026\u201d\n\u201cThe industry is very complicated, and there are many factors involved. If you want to act, look for Huo Zheng or Gu Yuwu, okay? Don\u2019t mess around on your own. You\u2019re so innocent that you\u2019ll be easily cheated.\u201d\n\u201cI know, I know. I don\u2019t want to act anyway. It\u2019s so scary to be stared at by so many people while filming.\u201d\nQiao You\u2019an laughed. \u201cWhat\u2019s so scary? 1 saw the little goddess was acting very freely.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan felt embarrassed talking about this. She complained, \u201cSister-in-law, you\u2019re teasing me again!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not teasing you. The two little kids at home like it very much. They said you\u2019re as beautiful as a fairy,\u201d Qiao You\u2019an said with a smile.\nThe duo attended many shows for two days and bought quite a lot of things.\nCoincidentally, although the duo avoided the media, Lin Xiaowan was captured in the photo of a group of celebrities while she was covering her mouth as she was laughing and speaking to Qiao You\u2019an.\nA few observant netizens immediately noticed the \u2018young goddess\u2019 who recently appeared on television.\nLin Xiaowan only had a small cameo in the drama. She had never acted before that, and she was also not part of a management company. Not only that, she also did not have an extraordinary background. For this reason, many people began to wonder how she could attend Fashion Week.\nSome people speculated that it was due to Gu Yuwu\u2019s good relationship with Lin Xiaowan. They said that Gu Yuwu introduced her to influential people in the industry, hoping to use Lin Xiaowan in some way. In short, they spoke as though they knew what was happening.\nThere were even a number of people who said that Lin Xiaowan was able to attend Fashion Week and wear branded clothing because she had a sugar daddy.\nLin Xiaowan was stunned when she saw these comments. She was eating with Qiao You\u2019an when she found out about this.\nQiao You\u2019an was naturally unhappy. She complained about Huo Zheng immediately. \u201cWhat is Huo Zheng doing? Why aren\u2019t his subordinates monitoring the news online?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan was also displeased that Gu Yuwu was dragged into this matter. \u201cWhy are they talking about Sister Yuwu like that? They\u2019re really ridiculous.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis has nothing to do with you. Someone probably doesn\u2019t like Gu Yuwu and took this opportunity to cause trouble for her. You don\u2019t have to worry too much. You don\u2019t know what Gu Yuwu is capable of.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan pouted. \u201cBut we can\u2019t just let them get away with this, right?\u201d\nAt the same time, Qiao You\u2019an sent a message to the family group chat, scolding Huo Zheng.\nLin Xiaowan also sent a message, expressing her unhappiness about Gu Yuwu being dragged into this matter.\nHuo Zheng did not care about this. He only said, \u201cIt\u2019s the entertainment industry after all. They like making mountains out of molehills. I\u2019ll remove the news later.\u201d\n\u201cBut 1 don\u2019t like them talking about Sister Yuwu like that. It\u2019s so unpleasant.\u201d\nGu Yuwu was accompanying her dear husband on a trip. The time difference was huge where she was. Based on the time, she was likely sleeping at this moment and was unaware of the rumors that were being spread about her.\nWhen Gu Yuwu and her husband were dating, she had strictly told him that he was not to interfere in her life in the entertainment industry whether it was good or bad. As such, he had always been like an invisible person in this regard.\nQiao You\u2019an looked at Lin Xiaowan who was reading the comments angrily. Her face was puffed up, and she looked extremely cute.\nQiao You\u2019an said with a smile, \u201cIt\u2019s fine. Don\u2019t worry. Just say whatever you want to them. There\u2019s no need to be so conflicted.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan scoffed, putting her phone away as she muttered, \u201cHa, 1 hate brainless people the most! What sugar daddy? I really hate people who make speculations maliciously!\u201d\nQiao You\u2019an said, trying to appease her, \u201cDon\u2019t you have a photo with me? Why don\u2019t you post it for everyone to see? Let them know you don\u2019t have a sugar daddy.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan was still thinking about how to respond when she heard Qiao You\u2019an\u2019s words. She paused for a moment. Indeed, they had taken a lot of photos during their trip. She had even carefully edited them before sending them to the family\u2019s group chat.\nLin Xiaowan said hesitantly, \u201cIsn\u2019t that bad for you? You rarely appear in the media after all.\u201d\nIt was not just Qiao You\u2019an. The two Huo brothers were the same. They rarely posted photos of their private lives.\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine.

We also ate many delicious things. One of the restaurants was strongly recommended by a designer!]\nLin Xiaowan posted two photos of her Qiao You\u2019an. One was of them at one of the shows, and the other was of them eating at a restaurant, showing many delicacies on the table. She had previously sent the photo to the group chat, making the four men of the Huo family envious.\nNeedless to say, Lin Xiaowan\u2019s post quickly attracted a lot of comments.\nUnexpectedly, someone said that the photos only proved that Lin Xiaowan attended Fashion Week with a family member. The other party pointed out that Lin Xiaowan did not say anything about Gu Yuwu \u2018pimping\u2019 her out or that she had a sugar daddy, saying that her silence was acquiescence.\nLin Xiaowan frowned and quickly responded to the comment.\n[Lin Xiaowan: Don\u2019t be ridiculous. Sister Yuwu and my sister-in-law are friends as well. We all know each other. Where did this brainless person come from? Go away! ]\n[Lin Xiaowan: Sister Yuwu is away on a trip with her husband. They should be sleeping now. I\u2019m going to tell her about this later!!!]\nLin Xiaowan added three exclamations to show her seriousness to those who were making wild speculations.\nHowever, some netizens seemed to miss the point and focused on a rather strange thing.\n[Netizen #1: Eh, your tone is like a child who has been bullied and is going to complain to an adult.]\n[Netizen #2: So cute! That\u2019s right. All those brainless people should go away! Let these beautiful women live their lives!]\n[Netizen tty 1 can just imagine the goddess\u2019 face that still has a little baby fat and her voice when reading her comments. There\u2019s no lethality at all when she said those harsh words! ]\nAlthough Qiao You\u2019an media presence was quite low, Huo Cheng was a prominent figure after all. He would even appear in international news sometimes. No matter how low-key she was, as his wife, people still knew her.\n\nTherefore, it did not take long before people recognized Qiao You\u2019an in Lin Xiaowan\u2019s photos.\nLin Xiaowan said nervously, \u201cSister-in-law, so many people are talking about you now. Will this affect you? Should I delete this post and post something else?\u201d\nAt this time, the two women were applying skincare products on their faces before going to bed.\nQiao You\u2019an said nonchalantly, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about this. When your engagement to Huo Zheng is announced, even more people will know about this. If you delete it now, people are going to speculate again and say you\u2019re feeling guilty.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan was confused. \u201cWhy would they think I feel guilty?\u201d\nQiao You\u2019an explained, \u201cThink about it. After posting photos with me, you deleted them before posting something else. People would think you were lying and felt guilty so you deleted the photos.\u201d\n\u201cAh, why is it so complicated? There are too many twists and turns.\u201d\nHowever, Lin Xiaowan\u2019s little worry quickly disappeared.\nAfter Qiao You\u2019an comforted Lin Xiaowan, she washed her face before she logged onto her account and reposted the photos with a hugging emoji. After that, she did not forget to remind Huo Zheng not to act rashly.\nAlthough Huo Zheng did not fully understand Qiao You\u2019an\u2019s meaning, he still listened to her advice. After all, she was not only his sister-in-law, but he knew she also cared about Lin Xiaowan. There was no doubt that she would not do anything that harmed the family.\nAfter attending the shows, the two women finally flew back.\nLin Xiaowan\u2019s award-winning painting had already been framed in a beautiful and exquisite frame. As soon as she returned, she contacted Lin Qing and told him that she was going to send him the painting. Coincidentally, Lin Qing had a small request.\n\u201cSince you\u2019re in Shengjing,\u201d Lin Qing said, \u201cCan you send some flower seeds?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan naturally agreed. \u201cWhat kind of flower seeds do you want?\u201d\n\u201cAnything is fine. You can pick whatever you like.\u201d\n\u201cAlright.\u201d\n\nLin Qing was pleasantly surprised when he received the painting. He really liked it, especially the elves and gnomes in the fruit and vegetable garden. It made him feel warm thinking about being surrounded by so many cute little creatures.\nThe Huo family\u2019s banquet was fast approaching.\nDue to the time constraint, some of the dresses Lin Xiaowan bought had yet to arrive. In the end, she chose to wear a dusty blue tufted dress with delicate gauze and star-like embellishments. It accentuated her flawless skin.\nHuo Zheng hugged her waist and said unhappily, \u201cYou\u2019re too skinny. Where does the food you eat go?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan spun around in front of the mirror. \u201c1 don\u2019t think so. 1 think I look good like this.\u201d\nHuo Zheng took the necklace from her hand and helped her put it on. He lowered his head and carefully fastened the clasp for her. The necklace was from Qiao You\u2019an\u2019s collection. It had an excellent emerald pendant. She paired it with a pair of earrings and bracelets, which were a wedding gift from Qiao You\u2019an.\nHuo Zheng said, \u201cYour aesthetics are weird. You\u2019re too skinny.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan snorted softly. She said with a pout, \u201cYou\u2019re the one who has a weird aesthetic. Your clothes are always black, dark blue, or gray.\u201d\nThe stylist had applied light makeup for Lin Xiaowan. The coral lipstick she applied was glossy, making her look especially cute when she pouted.\nHuo Zheng lowered his head and kissed her lightly. \u201cThen why don\u2019t you help me pick out my clothes, Qingqing? I\u2019ll wear the clothes you pick for me from now on.\u201d\nIn fact, Lin Xiaowan did not have confidence in this aspect. After all, the few times she had dressed him, she had chosen extremely casual and youthful clothes. It was a far cry from his mature and steady image at work.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to,\u201d Lin Xiaowan said, pushing him away, \u201cHey, don\u2019t kiss me. You\u2019re going to ruin my lipstick.\u201d\nHuo Zheng smiled and did not say anything. However, he intentionally rubbed his face against hers.\nThe banquet was held in the huge banquet room at the Huo family\u2019s old residence.\nNot many people were in attendance, and those who were invited were close family friends and business partners. The guests were carefully selected by Qiao You\u2019an and Huo Cheng. It could be said that those who were invited to the banquet were also those who would be invited to the wedding.\nThe reason the number of guests was small was due to their consideration of Lin Xiaowan. They knew she was nervous in a big crowd so they only invited those closest to them.\nThe banquet usually had more guests since its purpose was to interact with their peers. However, despite the number of guests, it seemed to be grander than before. As such, many guests were confused. However, after asking around, they found out what was going on.\nFor now, Huo Cheng was still main character in the banquet room.

She always goes there for afternoon tea with her friends.\u201d\nHuo Cheng said with a smile, \u201cIt\u2019s much more convenient for us. We can eat all kinds of cakes and desserts that Xiaowan makes herself. Many of them are not for sale.\u201d\nHuo Cheng sounded a little like he was bragging just like a parent who was proud of his child.\nAnother person asked, \u201cHow come Second Mrs. Huo hasn\u2019t been going to the shop recently?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s something that just happened. She\u2019s been busy with other things recently.\u201d \u201cBusy with other things? 1 heard that she won an art competition recently.\u201d\n\u201cI wonder when President Huo and the young lady got together? It seems very sudden. Which family is she from?\u201d\nThe title \u2018President Huo\u2019 was used exclusively for Huo Zheng since he managed the entire group. On the other hand, Huo Cheng, who was a prominent figure in the political world, was usually addressed as Mr. Huo.\n\u201cThe Huo family never cares about these things. We\u2019ve known Xiaowan for a long time now. She\u2019s not a young lady from a prestigious family; she\u2019s only from an ordinary family. In the end, everyone\u2019s the same after all. We\u2019re all ordinary people from ordinary families.\u201d\nIn fact, Huo Cheng\u2019s words were very modest. If the Huo family was considered ordinary, then what about ordinary people?\nNonetheless, everyone could see that Lin Xiaowan was extremely favored by the Huo family.\nIn the huge changing room upstairs.\n\nQiao You\u2019an knocked on the door.\n\u201cAre you done changing, Xiaowan?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan hurriedly pushed the man next to her away and replied, \u201cSister-in-law, I\u2019m done.\u201d\nQiao You\u2019an walked into the room. She was wearing a champagne-colored slim-fitting dress. She looked like an elegant and intellectual beauty.\nLin Xiaowan was instantly mesmerized by Qiao You\u2019an. She exclaimed, \u201cWow! Sister-in-law, you look extremely beautiful!\u201d\n\u201cWhat a sweet mouth,\u201d Qiao You\u2019an said with a smile, \u201cGu Yuwu is here. She\u2019s talking to President Cheng of Chenghong Technology on the balcony. She was worried you wouldn\u2019t be able to find her later so she sent me here to tell you about this.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan held Qiao You\u2019an\u2019s arm and said, \u201cOkay. By the way, what should I do later? Is it enough for me to just show my face?\u201d\n\u201cYes. I was worried you\u2019d feel uncomfortable. Let Huo Cheng and Huo Zheng deal with it. You don\u2019t have to worry about this.\u201d\nThe media was not invited to the banquet, after all.\nDuring the banquet, Lin Xiaowan held Huo Zheng\u2019s hand the entire time. Occasionally, when they spoke, he would lower his head slightly and look at her with a gentle expression on his face. Based on his attitude, many things were obvious.\nLin Xiaowan could feel many people\u2019s eyes on her. She was a little reserved, but she was not as afraid of being stared at as before. After a short while, she lifted her dress slightly and went to the balcony to look for Gu Yuwu. After chatting for a while, she sent someone to tell Huo Zheng that she and the others were going to see Little Chestnut.\nSince the women were together, Huo Zheng did not want to disturb them. He only said to the employee in a low voice, \u201cGet the kitchen to prepare some light snacks and send them over.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan did not eat much, and he was worried she would be hungry.\nCheng Ruitong had seen videos of Little Chestnut, and this was her first time meeting it. For this reason, she was shocked when she saw the large furball.\n\u201cI thought it was quite big when I saw it in the videos. However, it\u2019s even bigger than 1 imagined.\u201d\n\nLittle Chestnut\u2019s temperament was quite good. It was cute and not afraid of strangers at all. It circled the few of them curiously and even took its toys over to play with them. Its huge fluffy tail pointed up, looking like a feather duster.\nGu Yuwu chuckled. \u201cIt\u2019s so soft!\u201d\nLin Xiaowan said, \u201cIt\u2019s suspected that Little Chestnut\u2019s father is a Maine Coon. That\u2019s why she\u2019s so big.\u201d\nIn fact, Little Chestnut looked big because of its fluffy fur as well. Its fur was soft and felt extremely good to the touch. Lin Xiaowan particularly liked hugging Little Chestnut when she was watching movies, stroking it endlessly.\nAfter a while, Gu Yuwu asked Lin Xiaowan if she had been on Speaker recently. Lin Xiaowan shook her head slightly and said, \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of things going on recently. I\u2019ll be moving to Xilin Imperial Garden soon. I\u2019ve been decorating Little Chestnut\u2019s room recently. 1 saw a lot of cat supplies, and 1 really like all of them.\u201d\nThe house in Xilin Imperial Garden was big. An entire floor had been cleared out to be used as Little Chestnut\u2019s room. It even came with a few rooms. Lin Xiaowan had also hired a groomer to come over regularly to groom Little Chestnut.\nAfter saying that, Lin Xiaowan asked, \u201cDid those nonsense comments affect you?\u201d\nCheng Ruitong was the president of a company, after all. She had so many things to do every day that she wished she could clone herself. Apart from work matters, she rarely paid attention to other matters. As she teased Little Chestnut, she asked, \u201cWhat nonsense comments?\u201d\nGu Yuwu scoffed disdainfully before she said, \u201cYour family worked fast. When 1 woke up, nothing was left. However, one of my employees took screenshots so 1 scolded them one by one.\u201d\nAfter that, Gu Yuwu briefly explained that she was accused of being a \u2018pimp\u2019 and that she was looking for a sugar daddy for Lin Xiaowan. She also told about how some people actually believed these ridiculous and groundless accusations.\n\u201cI really hate people who spout nonsense like this. It\u2019s not just those netizens, but I hate people who are like this in real life as well,\u201d Lin Xiaowan said.\nBack when she was staying with her grandmother, the old women in the neighborhood loved to gossip the most. Her life at that time was not peaceful, and she could not even explain herself. For this reason, she hated people who made up ridiculous rumors the most.\nAlthough the matter was already over, Lin Xiaowan puffed her cheeks up and said sullenly, \u201cI\u2019m still angry whenever I think about it. I\u2019m going to post a photo after this!\u201d\nWith an idea in her mind, Lin Xiaowan took a photo of Gu Yuwu and Cheng Ruitong playing with Little Chestnut. She also asked Gu Yuwu to take a photo of her as well. She deliberately hid their faces. After that, she posted the few photos on Speaker.\n[Lin Xiaowan: Playing with Little Chestnut together-]\n\u2018Hmph, since those evil people like to speculate so much, then let them speculate! I won\u2019t say who is in these photos\u2026\u2019 Lin Xiaowan thought to herself smugly.

With this, the employees found out that red packets were a gift from the president to celebrate his engagement.\nLin Xiaowan was unaware of this. After posting the photos to Speaker that day, she had cleaned up her inbox. It was also at that time that she discovered a message from a small snack company asking if she could design a logo for their brand.\nThe company was not very famous. Lin Xiaowan searched for relevant information and saw that the company was registered not long ago. Clearly, they had only started their business recently. They mainly sold processed fruit products such as canned fruit, dried fruit, and fruit syrup. Although their sales volume was only average, the number of positive reviews was quite high. Even the negative reviews were only related to problems with the shipping and packaging. After reading the reviews carefully, she found that everyone liked their products.\nLin Xiaowan replied to the message, and the other party quickly called back.\nThe snack company was called The Laughing Buddha. They wanted a monkey in their logo because the three founders of the company were born in the year of the monkey. They were all fresh graduates so the budget given to Lin Xiaowan was not much. For this reason, the person who reached out to Lin Xiaowan felt slightly embarrassed.\n\u201cWell send you some of our products so you and your friends can try them\u2026\u201d\nTo Lin Xiaowan, money was not an important matter now. There was another thing that made her feel hesitant.\n\u201cI\u2019ve never designed a logo before so 1 don\u2019t know if I can do it well. However, I\u2019m quite interested in this. If you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019ll sketch out a draft for you to see first.\u201d\nThe other party said, filled with praise, \u201cWe\u2019ve seen your painting that you won an award for, and we really like your style.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan was surprised that the other party contacted her because of the artwork she submitted for the competition. She felt a surge of joy from being recognized.\nLin Xiaowan quickly went to work and completed the first draft quickly.\n\nThe little monkey she drew carried a small cloth sack over its shoulder. It had a strawberry in its mouth and carried various fruits in its hands. The small cloth sack was also filled with fruits. Even the necklace around its neck was made of litchi.\nLin Xiaowan showed Huo Zheng the first draft and asked, filled with anticipation, \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d\n\u201cIt looks good and cute. The other party will definitely like it.\u201d\nHuo Zheng, who was not very eloquent, tried his best to sound sincere. His expression was also serious as though he was looking at a billion-dollar contract.\nAfter that, Huo Zheng said, \u201cWe\u2019re moving tomorrow. Everything has been packed. 1\u201911 get the driver to send you there tomorrow. Also, see if you have left anything behind.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, okay,\u201d Lin Xiaowan replied with a nod as she hugged her sketchbook to her chest.\n\u201cAlright, you can continue drawing tomorrow. Go to sleep now, okay?\u201d Huo Zheng asked, bringing her pajamas over.\nThe deadline given by the other party was especially lenient. She had a week to show the other party the first draft so she was not in a hurry.\nThe next day.\nThey moved to the house in Xilin Imperial Garden. It was really big. The front yard and backyard were filled with newly planted flowers and plants; they were lush and full of vitality. After all, spring was the season of growth\nAunt Wu had also moved in and was waiting for Lin Xiaowan at the door.\nTheir things had been sent over in advance, and Little Chestnut\u2019s room was also almost completed.\nLin Xiaowan carried Little Chestnut and got out of the car. After that, she put Little Chestnut down so Little Chestnut could explore the new place. Then, she turned to look at Huo Zheng, who was in the midst of a conversation, and asked, \u201cWho are they?\u201d\nHuo Zheng was talking to a man and a woman at this time.\nThe man was a little older and a little overweight with an obvious beer belly. He was dressed in a well-tailored suit. All in all, he looked jolly and kind.\n\nOn the other hand, the woman looked very young; she was probably in her early twenties. She was dressed very fashionably, and her make-up was exquisite. Her hair was curled, and she wore her sunglasses on top of her head. At this time, she held the arm of the man next to her.\nUpon hearing Lin Xiaowan\u2019s question, Aunt Wu shook her head. \u201cI think they\u2019re here to give President Huo a gift. When we were moving two days ago, they came once. The man wanted to talk to President Huo but was rejected. I don\u2019t know why he came he again today\u2026\u201d\nLin Xiaowan asked curiously, \u201cIs that his daughter?\u201d\nThe young woman looked like she was at least 20 twenty years younger than the man. It seemed logical for her to be the man\u2019s daughter.\nAunt Wu almost burst out laughing, but she quickly held it in. Then, she leaned closer to Lin Xiaowan and whispered, \u201cI received them when they first came. They\u2019re a couple\u2026\u201d\nIn fact, calling the duo a couple was over-simplifying things. Aunt Wu had seen many people in her life. With just a glance, she could tell that one of them was not really willing. In any case, their relationship was clearly not simple.\nLin Xiaowan\u2019s eyes widened in surprise upon hearing those words. She thought to herself, \u2018With this age gap\u2026 It seems like they really love each other for them to be together\u2026\u2019\nLin Xiaowan no longer paid attention to this matter after that. She was just curious to see visitors as soon as she moved in. After asking about it, she threw the matter to the back of her mind.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a pond over there. I\u2019m going to put these fish in. Miss Lin, do you want to come and take a look?\u201d Aunt Wu asked, holding a small jar in her hands. There were another seven or eight jars on the ground. Each jar contained a different fish.\n\u201cWho bought them? Huo Zheng?\u201d Lin Xiaowan was slightly curious.\n\u201cYes,\u201d Aunt Wu said, \u201cThe landscaping company President Huo hired said that it\u2019d be good to raise fish in the small pond to add to the scenery\u2026\u201d\nAunt Wu continued to say, \u201cDidn\u2019t you see? The person who brought the fish over just left. He was very careful with all of them. It\u2019s obvious that the fish are not only beautiful, but they\u2019re expensive as well.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan did not know much about fish, but it did not stop her from nodding her head approvingly.\n\u201cI\u2019ll bring Little Chestnut into the house first before going to the small pond with you. Are we going to feed the fish? 1 want to feed the fish!\u201d\nAt this moment, Little Chestnut ran over to Huo Zheng and circled him curiously.\nHuo Zheng was already familiar with Little Chestnut at this point. He listened to the man flattering him as he calmly bent down to pick Little Chestnut up. However, Little Chestnut ignored him and quickly slipped away from his hands..\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

As soon as she bent down, Little Chestnut leaped into her arms.\nWhen the rotund man saw Lin Xiaowan, the smile on his face widened before he said, \u201cI\u2019ve long heard of the Second Madam. 1 finally got to meet her. Hello!\u201d\nLin Xiaowan was slightly overwhelmed by the other party\u2019s enthusiasm. She hesitated, wondering if she should reach out to shake the other party\u2019s hand. However, Little Chestnut was very big now, and it was difficult to pull her hand out at this moment. Then, she looked at Huo Zheng for help.\nHuo Zheng wrapped his arm around her waist. Although he was expressionless, his gaze was gentle. He ignored the man in front of him and asked Lin Xiaowan, \u201cHave you gone in to take a look? If there\u2019s anything missing, get someone to send it over.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan stroked the cat in her arms and said softly with a hint of excitement, \u201c1 haven\u2019t gone in yet. I\u2019m going to follow Aunt Wu to release the fish in the pond after this.\u201d\nAfter that, she added, \u201cI saw Little Chestnut run here earlier. 1 was worried she would run away so I\u2019m going to put her in the house first.\u201d\nPerhaps women were sensitive to each other. Lin Xiaowan could tell that the young woman, who was holding the rotund man\u2019s arm, was paying close attention to her and Huo Zheng\u2019s simple conversation. Although the other party was quite discreet, she could still sense a hint of hostility. The other party\u2019s gaze was similar to those who used to gossip maliciously about her in her hometown.\nLin Xiaowan was a little curious and puzzled. After all, she was certain this was her first time meeting the other party.\nWhen Lin Xiaowan looked up, the young woman was not afraid at all. She smiled and said, filled with praise, \u201cYour cat is really beautiful. When I\u2019m free, can I come over and play with your cat?\u201d\n\nThe young woman seemed to realize her words were a little abrupt after she finished speaking so she quickly added, \u201cI have a cat too. However, it\u2019s just an ordinary cat. It\u2019s not as beautiful as yours. What kind of cat is this? Was it expensive when you bought it?\u201d\nThe young woman spoke so much that Lin Xiaowan did not know how to respond for a moment. After a short moment, she said, \u201cI didn\u2019t buy it. 1 adopted it. Ordinary cats are also very beautiful. No, all cats are beautiful.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan did not have a very good impression of the young woman due to the hostility she sensed from the other party. As such, she naturally did not want to have any further intersection with the other party if possible. It would be troublesome if the other party visited using Little Chestnut as an excuse.\nHuo Zheng could tell Lin Xiaowan was unwilling. Without giving the young woman a chance to speak again, he hugged Lin Xiaowan and said gently, \u201cAlright, you can go in first. Didn\u2019t you say you\u2019re going to release the fish with Aunt Wu?\u201d\nAs soon as Lin Xiaowan left with Little Chestnut, his gentle aura vanished immediately, and he was back to looking aloof.\nThe rotund man came hoping to get the Huo Corporation to invest in his project. However, after listening for a while, Huo Zheng already found many flaws with the projects. It was definitely not a promising project. He did not want to waste his time listening to the other party anymore and said a few words to send the other party away.\nThe man, who wanted to cooperate with Huo Zheng, naturally had an ulterior motive. His company had suffered a loss and urgently needed investment. On the surface, the company seemed stable and prosperous, but only he and a few of his confidants knew that the company was losing money. At this rate, it would not be long before the company went under. For this reason, he was very reluctant to leave. After all, it would not be so easy for him to meet Huo Zheng again.\nAfter listening to the young woman\u2019s earlier words, an idea appeared in the rotund man\u2019s mind. He quickly said, \u201cYou just moved here so I\u2019m sure you have many things to deal with. I won\u2019t disturb you anymore. If you don\u2019t mind, she\u2019ll come over and play with the cat when she has the time.\u201d\n\u201cNo need,\u201d Huo Zheng said lightly before sending the duo away.\nThe man\u2019s surname was Li, and he was known as Old Mr. Li. He knew his place and did not continue to pester Huo Zheng. After he left with Lu Yingxin, his little lover, his expression was no longer amiable like before. He shook off Lu Yingxin\u2019s hand and warned her, \u201cDo you want to cling to a rich and powerful person? Keep your greedy eyes away from President Huo. He\u2019s not someone you can afford to provoke.\u201d\nThe smile on Lu Yingxin\u2019s face froze for a moment. However, she recovered quickly and reached out to hold Old Mr. Li\u2019s hand again as though nothing happened. She said ingratiatingly, \u201cHubby, what are you talking about? 1 don\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t think I don\u2019t know about your filthy thoughts,\u201d Old Mr. Li said with a sneer, \u201cYou also have a cat? What cat do you have? Weren\u2019t you just trying to get closer to him?\u201d\n\nLu Yingxin giggled. She did not seem to care that they were still outside as she deliberately leaned against Old Mr. Li\u2019s body and said, \u201cWell, I\u2019m the cat\u2026 Doesn\u2019t Old Mr. Li like this cat?\u201d\nOld Master Li\u2019s breathing quickened. He tightened his hold on her and said meaningfully, \u201cSee how 1 deal with you when we get home.\u201d\nThe house in Xilin Imperial Garden was big. The room with the best lighting on the first floor was used as Lin Xiaowan\u2019s studio.\nLin Xiaowan did not have much to do after moving. After communicating with the person from The Laughing Buddha, the snack company, she devoted herself to sketching the logo.\nThis was the first time someone had hired Lin Xiaowan to do such a thing. As such, she was filled with enthusiasm.\nThe snack company initially thought the entire process would take about a month. However, from the time the first draft was submitted to the time the final draft was submitted, only two weeks had passed. Since the logo was an original work, it cost a little more.\nWhen the other party saw the first draft, he had given Lin Xiaowan a 30% deposit. After the final draft was submitted, he readily transferred the remaining payment to her. He really liked the little monkey that Lin Xiaowan drew. Although the company was not well-off, they did not delay the payment at all.\nLin Xiaowan was very happy with the other party\u2019s attitude. After getting paid, she called Huo Zheng excitedly.\n\u201cHuo Zheng! I made money! I\u2019ll treat you to dinner tonight!\u201d\nLin Xiaowan could not conceal her happiness at all. Although this was not her first time getting paid, she felt as though she had just started working and had just received her first pay.\nHuo Zheng happily agreed before he said, \u201cYou\u2019re finally willing to talk to me? You\u2019ve been holed up in the studio recently. You were even busier than me.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan smiled sheepishly. Indeed, she had not paid much attention to Huo Zheng over the past two days. She had been focused on designing the logo. After all, if nothing unexpected happened, the company would use the logo for a very long time. Even if there were changes in the future, it was likely that the changes would not be big. Hence, she was very focused when designing it, paying attention to all the details.\n\u201cWhat should we eat tonight?\u201d\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

After all, I\u2019m the one treating you to a meal.\u201d\n\u201cThen I\u2019ll have to think about it.\u201d\n\u201cOkay. However, you\u2019re not allowed to pick somewhere extremely expensive!\u201d Lin Xiaowan quickly said, \u201cNevermind, you don\u2019t have to think about it. I\u2019ll do the choosing instead!\u201d\n\u201cOkay, okay. Then will you come and pick me up from work, Qingqing?\u201d Huo Zheng asked gently. Then, he quickly added, \u201cSister-in-law often goes to pick Brother up from work.\u201d\nIn fact, Huo Zheng was not being very truthful. Qiao You\u2019an did not go to Huo Cheng\u2019s office if there was nothing important.\nLin Xiaowan did not think too much about it and said, \u201cAlright. Then, I\u2019ll tell the driver about this.\u201d\nLate in the afternoon.\nThe driver was waiting while Lin Xiaowan was choosing what shoes to wear at the entrance.\nAt this moment, Aunt Wu came over and said there was a visitor looking for Lin Xiaowan. The other party was Lu Yingxin, the young woman from the other day, so she did not dare to casually let the other party in.\nLin Xiaowan put her shoes on as she asked hesitantly with a frown on her face, \u201cDid she say why she came?\u201d\nAunt Wu replied, \u201cShe carried a cat with her. She said she wanted the cats to socialize. I guess she means that she wants the cats to play together\u2026\u201d\nLin Xiaowan had sensed the other party\u2019s bad vibes so she was naturally not willing to meet the other party. She asked, \u201cWhere\u2019s the driver? In the front porch?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan called the driver and asked the driver to wait for her in the underground garage. She could directly take the elevator down to the garage in the house. With this, she could avoid the other party.\nAfter ending the call, she said to Aunt Wu, \u201cI don\u2019t know her. Just tell her that I have something to do and that I have to leave. Don\u2019t let her in.\u201d\nAunt Wu had spent quite some time with Lin Xiaowan so she had a certain understanding of Lin Xiaowan. As soon as she heard Lin Xiaowan\u2019s words, she naturally knew Lin Xiaowan\u2019s meaning.\nAfter Lin Xiaowan left, Aunt Wu walked to the gate and said in a neither servile nor arrogant manner, \u201cI\u2019m really sorry, Miss. Second Madam has something to do and has already gone out.\u201d\nIt had been ten minutes since Aunt Wu went in and came out again. Lu Yingxin knew that Lin Xiaowan was likely unwilling to see her. It did not matter if Lin Xiaowan had gone out or not, and it did not matter if it was true or not. No matter what, the result would be the same: she could not enter the house.\nLu Yingxin had noticed a silver Maybach parked on the front porch earlier when she arrived. However, in fewer than two minutes, it drove away. She surmised that the driver was picking up Lin Xiaowan.\nThinking about the big house, the luxury car, and how Lin Xiaowan had a driver to drive her around, Lu Yingxin felt extremely jealous and envious. She felt that it was extremely unfair. They were clearly about the same age. Why did she have to work so hard to please and flatter a fat old man only to get a bag while the other party could just sit back and enjoy all the wealth and glory? Moreover, previously, she was also scolded by the old man for having filthy thoughts.\nThe more Lu Yingxin thought about it, the more unwilling she felt.\n\u2018He\u2019s just a man no matter what. I don\u2019t believe that a man can remain unmoved when faced with temptation\u2026\u2019\nWith this thought in mind, Lu Yingxin adjusted her expression and said with a polite smile, \u201cThen I\u2019ll visit again next time. I saw that there\u2019s a cat here the other days so 1 thought we\u2019d be able to exchange tips on raising cats\u2026\u201d\nLu Yingxin stroked the cat as she spoke. The cat had orange fur and round eyes. It was small and looked listless. Perhaps it was wary of the environment, it looked a little nervous as well.\nAlthough Aunt Wu thought that there was no need for Lu Yingxin to visit again, she still smiled when she sent Lu Yingxin away.\nWhen Lu Yingxin returned home, she casually tossed the small orange cat aside. It was not easy for her to come to Xilin Imperial Garden. Old Mr. Li had bought a house here, and she had to beg him every time she wanted to come over. The security of Xilin Imperial Garden was very tight so she could not casually come over on her own.\nInitially, after convincing Old Mr. Li to let her come over, she thought she would be able to get closer to Lin Xiaowan. Unexpectedly, she failed to even see Lin Xiaowan, let alone speak to Lin Xiaowan.\n\nLu Yingxin found the cat to be an eyesore. She had bought the cat from a market for a very low price. In her eyes, it was thin and ugly. It did not want to get close to her at all. It trembled in her arms when she carried it.\n\u201cStupid cat! You\u2019re really ungrateful! If I didn\u2019t buy you, you would\u2019ve been abandoned!\u201d Lu Yingxin said angrily as she kicked the cat.\nThe little orange cat yowled. After a while, it crawled over shakily to drink some water in a small bowl. Then, it curled up into a ball and lay still.\nOn the way to the Huo Corporation, Lin Xiaowan bought a bouquet of flowers. She was not very sure if Huo Zheng liked flowers. However, women were always happy to receive flowers. Although he was a man, she thought that he should be happy too.\nBefore she arrived, she received a call from Huo Zheng.\n\u201cQingqing, where are you?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m waiting at the traffic light near the intersection. I should arrive within ten minutes.\u201d\nHuo Zheng replied, \u201cOkay. I have a last-minute meeting. I\u2019ll tell my assistant to wait for you at the entrance. Come up and wait for me, okay?\u201d\nEvery time Huo Zheng spoke to Lin Xiaowan, his voice was gentle. It sounded like he was coaxing her.\n\u201cOkay, it\u2019s fine if you have work. There\u2019s no rush,\u201d Lin Xiaowan said easily.\nThe doorman recognized Huo Zheng\u2019s car and number plate. The car had just pulled and had yet to stop completely when he had already stepped forward to open the door. When he saw a slender hand reaching out, he was stunned and instinctively looked up.\nLin Xiaowan held a large bouquet of flowers and smiled at the doorman, revealing her dimples. She said softly, \u201cThank you.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d the doorman quickly said before he added tentatively, \u201cS-second Madam?\u201d\nBefore Lin Xiaowan could reply, Huo Zheng\u2019s assistant, who was waiting at the entrance, walked over. \u201cHello, Second Madam.\u201d\n\u201cHello.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan nodded at the doorman again before she left with the assistant. Since it was still within working hours, the employees were still around. When the receptionist on duty saw Huo Zheng\u2019s assistant leading a young woman holding a bouquet of flowers to the elevator, she perked up immediately. She did not waste time and sent a message to the group chat.\n[Receptionist: Second Madam is here! The president\u2019s assistant brought her to use the president\u2019s special elevator!

I\u2019m sitting next to her. Her expression is extremely ugly now! Hahaha!]\nLin Xiaowan was quickly brought to Huo Zheng\u2019s office by his assistant.\nThe receptionist on Huo Zheng\u2019s floor saw Lin Xiaowan, and her eyes lit up immediately.\nThere were also a few secretaries and assistants on the floor, and their number was small.\nFortunately, they were seated a distance away, and Lin Xiaowan could avoid the awkwardness of having to greet everyone. Nonetheless, she was still very very tense. She could feel everyone\u2019s burning gaze when she walked past. She heaved a sigh of relief when she finally entered the office. She felt as though she was a thief sneaking into Huo Zheng\u2019s office, trying to avoid being discovered.\nThe assistant coughed lightly and said, \u201cSecond Madam, what would you like to drink? President Huo said the weather is still cold so you can\u2019t drink cold drinks. How about some warm milk?\u201d\n\u2018Who would drink warm milk at this hour?\u2019\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Lin Xiaowan said before asking, \u201cWhat else is there? I want to drink lemonade.\u201d\nThe assistant said sympathetically, \u201cHot lemonade won\u2019t taste good. Are you okay with that, Second Madam?\u201d\n\u201cCan\u2019t I have it at room temperature?\u201d Lin Xiaowan asked in shock.\n\u2018Why must it be hot?!\u2019\n\u201cRoom temperature is still quite cold so\u2026\u201d the assistant said, looking helpless.\nLin Xiaowan pursed her lips. If she had a tail, it would droop in disappointment at this moment.\nThe assistant suggested, \u201cWhat about some hot milk tea?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan nodded. \u201cThat sounds good. Is there anything to eat? Chips? Some other snacks?\u201d\nThe assistant looked at Lin Xiaowan meaningfully, and she wilted immediately. She understood. Huo Zheng had already instructed the other party not to give her any snacks.\nAfter the assistant left, Lin Xiaowan punched the soft pillow angrily to vent her anger.\n\u2018This is outrageous! Huo Zheng is too stingy!\u2019\nLin Xiaowan felt like fainting from her anger. Huo Zheng had always paid attention to her diet since she was a little weak. If she ate too much, it would cause indigestion and flatulence. In short, she had stomach problems so he paid more attention to her diet. Not long ago, he coaxed her into agreeing to only have cold drinks during summer. In a moment of confusion, she had promised him. After that, she really regretted it. She wanted to break her promise several times after that but failed to find a chance to do so. Now that she thought about it again, she really wanted to bite him in anger.\n\u2018How can I only be allowed to drink cold drinks in summer?! Ahhhhhh!\u2019\nAfter the special assistant served the milk tea, she tasted it. She was rather satisfied. Due to how delicious it was, she soon forgot about her anger.\nAt this moment, the phone in her bag, which had been casually tossed aside, rang once. Before she could retrieve her bag, it rang again.\n\nLin Xiaowan found it strange. After all, her social circle was very small. She usually did not receive many calls. Soon enough, she discovered it was Zhu Yingyue.\nZhu Yingyue was the one who opened the dessert shop with Lin Xiaowan, and she was in charge of the operation of the shop and capital management.\n\u201cHello, Sister Zhu. Is everything okay?\u201d\nZhu Yingyue laughed when she heard Lin Xiaowan\u2019s voice. She said, \u201cI just transferred the dividends to you. Did you receive the message from the bank yet? Guess how much we earned last quarter?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan had no concept of this at all. However, based on Zhu Yingyue\u2019s tone, it seemed like they had earned a lot. She asked, \u201c200,000?\u201d\n\u201cThe turnover is 2.93 million.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan thought she had misheard Zhu Yingyue. \u201cSister, did you mistakenly add another zero? We just opened the dessert shop not long ago Moreover, 1 remember the turnover last time was not even a fraction of this, right?\u201d\nZhu Yingyue said happily, \u201cWith you as a living advertisement, how can we not make money? Moreover, how can that be considered a lot? One of your limited edition bags or your haute couture dresses probably cost much more than that\u2026\u201d\nLin Xiaowan felt embarrassed when she heard these words. She only said sheepishly, \u201cIs that so\u2026\u201d\nZhu Yingyue was in a good mood. Now that she was making money, she also had much more confidence. She no longer had to bow her head and asked for living expenses from her cheating husband. She had gained the confidence to live independently. With a little more time, when she had more chips in her hand, she would definitely get a divorce.\n\u201cI wonder if you\u2019re free? I want to treat you to a meal. What do you think?\u201d\n\u201cThat sounds good! However, I can\u2019t do it today. 1 have plans today. Why don\u2019t we do it on another day?\u201d\n\u201cOkay! Think about what you want to eat!\u201d\nAfter ending the call, Lin Xiaowan\u2019s smile did not fade. She opened the message on her phone, and when she saw the amount of money she received, her eyes widened. Her mouth was also so wide open that it could fit a duck egg. \u2018There\u2019s more than 700,000 yuan! Am 1 going to be rich? Is this the feeling of making money? 1 can\u2019t believe I made this money on my own!\u2019\nHuo Zheng\u2019s last-minute meeting ended quickly. When he walked into the office, he saw Lin Xiaowan curled up on the couch with a shocked expression on her face. As he walked over, he loosened his tie. There was no need to be too formal since they were going to eat.\n\u201cQingqing, what are you looking at?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan was startled by him. When she recovered, she jumped up and hugged him as she said excitedly, \u201cHuo Zheng! I made money! I made money!\u201d Huo Zheng did not forget to praise her first before asking questions.. \u201cQingqing is really amazing!\u201d\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

She said, \u201cIt\u2019s the dividends from the dessert shop. We earned more than 700,000 yuan last quarter. Wow! It really increased by many times!\u201d\nThe first time Lin Xiaowan received the dividends it was only a few tens of thousands yuan. In just a few months, it had increased tenfold.\nHuo Zheng smiled sincerely and said, \u201cThat\u2019s amazing, Qingqing. You\u2019re really good at making money.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan did not take the credit. It was not because she was humble; it was because she was very aware of her abilities. She said, \u201cIt\u2019s not like that. This is all thanks to Sister Zhu. She\u2019s really awesome. By the way, she said that she wants to treat me to a meal.\u201d\nAt this time, Lin Xiaowan finally remembered the bouquet of roses she had placed on the table. She quickly gave it to Huo Zheng as she said, \u201cThis is for you! There\u2019s also this painting. You can display it in your office!\u201d\nPreviously, Huo Zheng had mentioned that he wanted her to paint something for him so he could display it on his desk. He only mentioned it once, and seeing that there was no movement from Lin Xiaowan after that, he assumed she had forgotten about it. He did not expect her to quietly bring it to him.\nShe painted a cartoon character, and it seemed out of place in Huo Zheng\u2019s office. Moreover, he placed it in such a conspicuous place on his desk. When others approached his desk, they would be able to see it at a glance.\nHuo Zheng held the roses in one hand and Lin Xiaowan\u2019s hand in the other as he said, \u201cWe\u2019ll follow your arrangements today?\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d Lin Xiaowan said happily.\nThe next two days were cloudy and rainy just as the weather forecast had predicted. However, when Lin Xiaowan woke up from her afternoon nap today, she found that the sky had cleared up. When she looked out the window, she saw a few people in the front yard, looking after the flowers and plants that had been transplanted.\nHuo Zheng did not care much about the flowers and plants. He only felt that the front yard was empty so he hired a landscaping team to deal with it. Lin Xiaowan also had no experience with taking care of flowers and plants. Seeing how expensive the flowers and plants were, she also got Huo Zheng to hire someone to take care of them.\nAt this moment, Little Chestnut was on the second floor. When Lin Xiaowan went down, she saw that the cameras were already turned on. It was live streaming, working hard to earn money for its own food.\nBefore moving in, the cameras had already been installed. There were several of them placed in different positions, and they would move up, down, left, and right, following Little Chestnut\u2019s movements. All she needed to do was to choose which camera to turn on using her computer. It was very convenient.\nAfter asking Aunt Wu which camera was turned on, Lin Xiaowan found a blind spot before she began to play with Little Chestnut, teasing it with a cat teaser wand. It played until it was dizzy.\n\nLin Xiaowan laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re so silly.\u201d\nRecently, Little Chestnut had been shedding a lot so fur could be seen all over the place.\n[Netizen #1: Ahhhh, you can\u2019t play with Little Chestnut like that! Let me do it!]\nLin Xiaowan played with Little Chestnut for a while before she finally left. After that, she called Zhu Yingyue, asking if the latter was free to have dinner together.\nZhu Yingyue agreed immediately. \u201cOf course, 1 have time. If you didn\u2019t call me,\n1 would\u2019ve called you. I\u2019m in the shop now. Should 1 pick you up?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan thought about it for a moment before she asked, \u201cWhere are we eating?\u201d\n\u201cSince I\u2019m treating you, you can choose the place.\u201d\n\u201cThen you don\u2019t have to pick me up. Moreover, Xilin Imperial Garden isn\u2019t that far from the dessert shop.\u201d\n\u201cAlright. There\u2019s no need to rush. We still have plenty of time until dinner.\u201d\n\u201cAlright.\u201d\nIt was quite cold outside after the rain. The temperature that had risen a few days ago had dropped again. Although the sun was out, the temperature was only slightly over io degrees.\nLin Xiaowan wore a thick sweater over a woolen dress and paired them with calfskin shoes to keep warm. Before leaving, she sent a message to Huo Zheng.\n[Lin Xiaowan: I\u2019m having dinner with Sister Yingyue tonight. You\u2019re on your own for dinner tonight-]\nHuo Zheng shook his head and smiled seeing how Lin Xiaowan spoke like a parent who was leaving her child behind. He reminded her to come back early and did not say anything else.\nThe driver was waiting for Lin Xiaowan on the front porch instead of the basement garage. As soon as she stepped outside, she was greeted by the cold spring breeze. She felt glad that she had dressed warmly.\nSince the heater was on in the car, Lin Xiaowan removed her coat after a few minutes. When she arrived at the dessert shop, she almost forgot about her coat. Fortunately, the driver reminded her.\n\nAs soon as Lin Xiaowan walked into the dessert shop, she could smell the sweet fragrance of pastries. It was 5 PM now, and a batch of freshly baked desserts had just come out of the kitchen. There were many people queueing up at this moment.\nOne of the employees noticed Lin Xiaowan and waved at her.\n\u201cBoss, you\u2019re here. Do you want anything to eat?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan peered into the kitchen and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s there to eat?\u201d\n\u201cSugar fritters,\u201d the head patissier said as he handed a tray of pastries over.\nThe pastries were deep-fried until they were golden yellow. They were crispy on the outside and soft and sweet inside with a unique fragrance.\nLin Xiaowan carried a plate of pastries over to Zhu Yingyue.\nZhu Yingyue smiled when she saw Lin Xiaowan. \u201cGreedy little cat. You only know how to eat when you\u2019re here.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know how strict Huo Zheng is with my diet\u2026\u201d Lin Xiaowan said with a pout.\nZhu Yingyue smiled in response to her childish words before she said, \u201cSince you\u2019re here, let me tell you about my plans.\u201d\n\u201cOkay. What are your plans?\u201d\nZhu Yingyue heard that the shop next door would be empty soon. As such, she wanted to open a shop where people could sign up for baking classes. She planned to organize group activities from time to time as well.\nLin Xiaowan did not doubt Zhu Yingyue\u2019s abilities. After listening to Zhu Yingyue\u2019s plans, she nodded and asked, \u201cOkay. How much do we need?\u201d\nZhu Yingyue did not expect Lin Xiaowan to trust her so much. Warmth suffused her heart immediately, and she was even more determined not to let Lin Xiaowan down. She said, \u201cI have enough money. However, there\u2019s something I need to trouble you with.\u201d\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Lin Xiaowan asked as she munched on the pastry.\nZhu Yingyue needed Lin Xiaowan to look for qualified patissiers to help with the baking classes. After all, many of the customers were quite wealthy, and their expectations were a little high.\n\u201cI have to trouble you to help me look for a few experienced and capable patissiers for the baking classes. It\u2019s best if they know how to make desserts from different countries..\u201d\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

She said, \u201cBut I don\u2019t know anyone. The best patissier is already working in our shop. The next best patissier 1 know is you, Sister.\u201d\nZhu Yingyue blushed upon hearing these words. How could she compare to an internationally recognized patissier? Although she felt that Lin Xiaowan was overestimating her ability, she could tell that Lin Xiaowan was sincere in her praise. It made her heart bloom with joy.\nAfter a moment, Zhu Yingyue said truthfully, \u201cPresident Huo has a lot of connections. I won\u2019t hide it from you. In fact, I have a few candidates in mind. However, I\u2019m afraid they might not want to work in a small shop like ours. Hence, I thought it\u2019d be better if you speak to them. Perhaps they\u2019ll be more inclined to join us on account of President Huo.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan did not have any objections so she agreed. \u201cThis shouldn\u2019t be a problem. Just send me the list of candidates. I\u2019ll try and talk to them.\u201d\nAfter discussing the matter of expanding the business, Zhu Yingyue asked Lin Xiaowan what the latter wanted to have for dinner.\nLin Xiaowan, who had just finished eating the sugar fritters, perked up immediately. She asked, \u201cSister, are you particular about food?\u201d\nAlthough Zhu Yingyue was rather wealthy, she lived a rather low-key lifestyle. She did not care much about her food and clothes. She said, \u201cNo. I can eat anything as long as it\u2019s not too spicy.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan looked at Zhu Yingyue with bright eyes as she said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we eat at food stalls? There\u2019s a food street in the university area!\u201d\nZhu Yingyue did not mind this, but she was slightly surprised by Lin Xiaowan\u2019s suggestion. \u201cWhy did you think of going there? What do you want to eat? I don\u2019t mind eating there. I eat junk food every now and then\u2026\u201d\nSeeing that Zhu Yingyue had no objection, Lin Xiaowan became even happier. She counted with her fingers as she said, \u201cI want to eat fried chicken wings, octopus balls, ice cream, fried yogurt slices, oden\u2026 1 want to eat everything!\u201d\n\nLin Xiaowan\u2019s eyes lit up as she continued to say, \u201cOh, there\u2019s a small stall there that sells meat pie! The meat pies there are extremely delicious. I wonder if the old lady is still selling meat pies there\u2026 The meat pies there are the best in the capital! If the stall is open, I want to eat five!\u201d\nSeeing how much Lin Xiaowan praised the stall, Zhu Yingyue also began to crave it. She said, \u201cAlright, then what are we waiting for? Let\u2019s go!\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s go! Let\u2019s go!\u201d\nLin Xiaowan rose to her feet immediately.\nSeeing how excited Lin Xiaowan was, Zhu Yingyue said with a helpless smile, \u201cPut on your coat. I saw you didn\u2019t wear your coat earlier when you came into the shop. It\u2019s cold now. Remember to wear your coat, understand?\u201d\nThe shop was rather warm so Lin Xiaowan did not wear her coat. If it were not for Zhu Yingyue\u2019s reminder, she would not have put on her coat until she felt the cold wind again.\nBefore leaving, Lin Xiaowan picked up her plate and returned it to the kitchen. While she was talking to one of the employees, she was suddenly interrupted.\n\u201cMiss Lin, what a coincidence! Do you like the desserts here as well?\u201d a surprised voice said from the side.\nLin Xiaowan turned around and saw the young woman she saw the day she moved into the house in Xilin Imperial Garden. Previously, the young woman had also come to visit her once but was turned away. As soon as she saw the other party, she really wished she could escape.\nLin Xiaowan did not know the other party, and she knew that it was not good to judge a book by its cover. However, she could not help but feel a sense of aversion toward the other party. Since there were many people around, she could only smile politely and say, \u201cWhat a coincidence.\u201d\nIt was obvious that Lin Xiaowan did not really want to talk, but Lu Yingxin did not care at all. She seized the opportunity to talk to Lin Xiaowan, saying, \u201cI brought my cat to visit you previously, but you weren\u2019t home. 1 didn\u2019t expect to meet you here. It seems like we can be considered fated, right?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan laughed awkwardly. \u201c1 guess.\u201d\nSeeing how uncomfortable Lin Xiaowan was, Zhu Yingyue said, \u201cLet\u2019s go. The traffic will be bad later.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay!\u201d Lin Xiaowan nodded vigorously before she said to Lu Yingxin, \u201cI have other things to do so I\u2019ll take my leave first.\u201d\n\u201cMay I ask where Miss Lin is going? It\u2019s almost time for dinner. I know a delicious Western restaurant nearby. How about I treat the two of you to a meal? I really want to be friends with Miss Lin,\u201d Lu Yingxin said enthusiastically as though she could not hear the refusal in Lin Xiaowan\u2019s words.\nLin Xiaowan was slightly annoyed by Lu Yingxin\u2019s inability to take a hint. She said, \u201cPerhaps another time. The two of us have plans today.\u201d\nLu Yingyin did not give up and decided to give it another try. \u201cThen can I visit you tomorrow or the day after tomorrow? I\u2019ll bring my kitten with me, and we can talk about cats.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan had a problem saying \u2018no\u2019 to people. She was defeated by Lu Yingxin\u2019s enthusiasm and could only nod reluctantly. However, she regretted it as soon as she nodded.\nLu Yingxin saw the regret on Lin Xiaowan\u2019s face, but she naturally would not let Lin Xiaowan go back on her words. She quickly brought her phone out and said, \u201cCan I have your number? With this, I don\u2019t have to worry about visiting when you\u2019re not around. In fact, it\u2019s not a big deal, but I just feel bad for my kitten. Ah, 1 just realized I didn\u2019t tell you my name. I\u2019m Lu Yingxin.\u201d\n\u2018If you feel bad for your kitten, then you should just stay at home. Can\u2019t you tell that I\u2019m unwilling?\u2019 Lin Xiaowan thought to herself.\nIn the end, they exchanged numbers. Otherwise, Lin Xiaowan was really worried Lu Yingxin would visit over and over again until she succeeded. That would not be good for the cat either. Previously, she heard from Aunt Wu that Lu Yingxin carried the cat over without any protection.\nAfter the two of them left, Zhu Yingyue asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s with her? She\u2019s a little too enthusiastic about you. It\u2019s like a tiger seeing meat.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan said, puzzled, \u201cI don\u2019t know either. 1 only met her once on the day I moved into the house in Xilin Imperial Garden. I saw her for five minutes at most. I really don\u2019t understand her.\u201d\nInitially, Lin Xiaowan wanted to say that she had a bad impression of Lu Yingxin and that she felt that Lu Yingxin was up to no good. However, on second thought, she felt that she did not know Lu Yingxin well enough to judge her.\nIn any case, the small episode was quickly thrown to the back of her mind. When they arrived at the food street, Lin Xiaowan was like a mouse that had been thrown into a bucket of rice.\nThe first stall at the entrance sold fried chicken and fried squid, and Lin Xiaowan happily queued up for them..\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

You were sweating in the car earlier. If you don\u2019t keep warm now, you\u2019ll catch a cold.11\n\u201cI know, 1 know.\u201d\nThe heater in the car was turned on high so Lin Xiaowan did not feel that cold after alighting from the car.\nAt 7 PM, Huo Zheng called Lin Xiaowan. At this time, Lin Xiaowan had already eaten quite a bit. She had already eaten three meat pies that she had been craving and fried chicken.\nSince Lin Xiaowan was not at home, lluo Zheng did not go home and decided to work overtime.\n\u201cHave you eaten?11\nSince it was a video call, Lin Xiaowan hurriedly handed the ice cream cone in her hand over to Zhu Yingyue before answering the call. She also gestured to Zhu Yingyue, asking the latter to hide it from lluo Zheng before she briefly pointed the camera at Zhu Yingyue.\n\u201cI\u2019m preparing to ear. I\u2019m going to have curry.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan did not mention the fried chicken drumsticks and wings or fries that she had eaten.\nDespite all her efforts, Huo Zheng still caught sight of the ice cream in Zhu Yingyue\u2019s hand. He asked with a frown, \u201cAre you having ice cream? It\u2019s still so cold out\u2026\u201d\nLin Xiaowan naturally did not dare to admit to that. She said guiltily, choosing to be half truthful, \u201cI, I\u2019m sharing it with Sister Yingyue\u2026 1 didn\u2019t eat much.\u201d Then, she gestured with her hand, showing how little she had eaten.\n\nHuo Zheng nodded. It was impossible to tell if he believed her or not. He continued to ask, \u201cWhat else did you eat? Don\u2019t eat anything too spicy or oily. If you really want to eat them, ask the chef at home to make them for you, okay?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan, who had already eaten most of these things, nodded. \u201cOkay.\u201d When she finally ended the call, the ice cream was about to melt. She quickly took the ice cream and ate it, completely disregarding Huo Zheng\u2019s words. Zhu Yingyue said, slightly worried, \u201cYou promised President lluo earlier\u2026\u201d Lin Xiaowan said with a pout, \u201cYou don\u2019t know this, but I rarely eat these things. It\u2019s fine just this once\u2026\u201d\nInwardly, she promised herself that she would admit her mistakes to Huo Zheng with tears in her eyes when she got home.\n\u201cAs long as you know your limits. 1 can\u2019t stop you,\u201d Zhu Yingyue said helplessly. Alas, Lin Xiaowan was someone who did not know her limits.\nLin Xiaowan returned home satisfied. As soon as she entered the house, Huo Zheng hugged her. When he touched her round belly, he said helplessly, \u201cWhy did you ear so much? Did you forget what the doctor said previously?\u201d However, knowing that he would not get an explanation about this matter, he changed the topic and asked, \u201cDid you enjoy yourself tonight?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan leaned against him as though she had no bones. She looked pleased as she said, \u201cI did! 1 want to eat fried chicken wings and fries tomorrow! How can French fries be so delicious? How can there be such delicious things in the world?\u201d\nlluo Zheng knew that she had already eaten those things earlier. Hence, he said immediately, \u201cNo.\u201d\nSince Lin Xiaowan had eaten many things that she could not usually eat today, she did not make a fuss when Huo Zheng rejected her. She nodded and said, \u201cOkay.\u201d\nIn the middle of the night.\nHuo Zheng felt something was wrong when he was woken up by Lin Xiaowan burrowing into his arms. She was moaning and holding her stomach. Her face was flushed, and a layer of sweat could be seen on her forehead and temples. \u201cStomachache?\u201d\nHe hugged her and rubbed her stomach gently as he kissed her forehead. However, he was shocked as soon as his lips touched her forehead. She was burning. lie asked worriedly, \u201cDo you feel unwell anywhere else?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan suspected that her stomach hurt because she had eaten too much oily stuff with additives after not eating them for a long time. She was in so much pain that she could only sniff and say, \u201cNo.\u201d\nlluo Zheng wanted to get a thermometer to measure Lin Xiaowan\u2019s temperature, but as soon as he got up, Lin Xiaowan tightened her hold on him. He patted her back gently as he whispered, \u201cBe good, okay? You have a fever. If the temperature is too high, we ll have to go to the hospital.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan was especially clingy when she was sick. She hugged lluo Zheng and refused to let go.\n\nSeeing the tears in her eyes, Huo Zheng was helpless. In the end, he wrapped her up in the blanket and carried her after he called Aunt Wu.\nlluo Zheng carried her downstairs and placed her on the couch.\nAunt Wu, who was staying on the first floor, rushed over with the medical box. She asked, \u201cWhy did she suddenly catch a fever? It must be the weather. The weather has been hot and cold recently\u2026\u201d\nLin Xiaowan\u2019s temperature was 38.5 degrees Celcius. Huo Zheng wanted to bring her to the hospital, but she was unwilling. After all, her stomach was not as painful as before, and she did not feel any other discomfort. She yawned and whispered, \u201cI don\u2019t want to go to the hospital. 1 want to go back to bed.\u201d\nThe medical box was very well-equipped. Huo Zheng carefully looked at several types of medicine and read the instructions before he found the medicine for fever and stomachache for her. Then, he told Aunt Wu to go to bed first before bringing Lin Xiaowan back to the bedroom.\n\u201cDrink some water before you go to sleep, okay?\u201d Huo Zheng said.\nLin Xiaowan nodded weakly.\nHuo Zheng held the glass to her mouth and fed her. After the glass was empty, he leaned over and kissed her before he said, praising her, \u201cQingqing is so obedient.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan said, embarrassed, \u201cDon\u2019t praise me at a time like this. It\u2019s just drinking water. Why do you act like I did something amazing\u2026\u201d\nLin Xiaowan had been yawning non-stop when she was downstairs. However, after drinking water and chatting, she was no longer as sleepy as before. Moreover, her stomachache came in waves. Although it was not particularly painful now, it was hard to ignore.\nHuo Zheng was not sleepy as well, lie placed his hand on her stomach and slowly massaged it for her. At the same time, he asked, \u201cWhat did you eat earlier, huh? Tell me who ate ice cream earlier when 1 called you?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan hesitated for a moment before she said, \u201cAlright, 1 admit it. I ate the ice cream.\u201d\nHuo Zheng knew her very well. Usually, she would only listen to him occasionally when he was around. However, when she was alone, how could she control herself? He continued to ask, \u201cWhat else did you eat?\u201d\n\u201cUh\u2026 That\u2019s it?\u201d\nHuo Zheng was both angry and amused.. \u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

Seeing that the person in his arms was about to fall asleep, Huo Zheng stopped teasing her and gently patted her to sleep.\nHowever, just as Lin Xiaowan was about to fall asleep, she suddenly felt a wave of nausea. The acid in her stomach seemed to surge. She got up, covered her mouth, and quickly ran to the bathroom. She was in such a rush that she did not wear her slippers at all. When she stepped on the cold tiles in the bathroom, a chill quickly spread up her feet.\nHuo Zheng reacted quickly and followed her into the bathroom. He carried her up after she vomited. He frowned when he checked her temperature again; it had risen.\nLin Xiaowan winced, and a layer of cold sweat appeared on her face again. She whimpered, saying, \u201cMy stomach hurts again.\u201d\nThe pain was even more intense than before. It felt as though her intestines were twisted. She had always been a little delicate when she was with Huo Zheng. As long as he was around, even a little pain seemed unbearable. With such excruciating pain, her tears fell immediately.\nHuo Zheng\u2019s heart ached when he looked at her. He kissed her as he said, coaxing her, \u201cLet\u2019s go to the hospital, okay?\u201d\nThe house in Xilin Imperial Garden did not have medical equipment. Even if he invited the private doctor over, the other party would not be able to examine her properly. It was better for them to go to the hospital.\nThe People\u2019s Hospital.\n\nLin Xiaowan\u2019s temperature was taken again when she was at the hospital. It had risen to 39 degrees Celcius. After the examination, she was diagnosed with acute enteritis, which also caused her fever.\nThe doctor who treated her was the same one who treated her in the past. He looked at her and said with a sigh, \u201cAcute enteritis is a relatively common digestive disease. There\u2019s no need to worry too much. It happens when you eat food contaminated with bacteria or viruses.\u201d\n\u201cOriginally, you already have chronic gastritis. However, judging by the scans, your stomach condition is not bad. You have to continue taking care of it. Pay attention to what you eat. The last time 1 saw you, 1 remember you had irritable bowel syndrome as well\u2026 Don\u2019t take this lightly just because you\u2019re young, understand?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan, who was in Huo Zheng\u2019s arms, lowered her head as she listened to the doctor obediently. She nodded like a chick pecking at grains as she said, \u201cYes, yes, I understand.\u201d\nShe seemed like she was reflecting on herself, but in fact, she did not listen to anything at all.\nIn the end, it was already close to dawn when everything was done. When the sun was about to rise, Lin Xiaowan finally fell asleep. Even when she was asleep, she was clinging to Huo Zheng, refusing to let him go.\nWhen she woke up again, it was already noon. She was woken up by the fragrance of food. When she opened her eyes, she discovered she was in a room painted in a warm color.\nA thermal lunch box sat on the small dining table next to the bed.\nAt some point, Gu Yuwu and her husband had come over. They were sitting on the couch with Huo Zheng at this moment, talking in low voices.\nLin Xiaowan sat up.\nWith just a slight sound, Huo Zheng stood up and strode over immediately. He touched her forehead as he said, \u201cYou\u2019re awake.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan\u2019s eyes were glued to the lunch box at this moment. \u201cIt smells so good\u2026\u201d\nHuo Zheng pinched her cheek lightly. \u201cThere\u2019s no chicken wings, French fries, or oden today.\u201d\nAunt Wu had personally cooked millet porridge for Lin Xiaowan. Honey, red dates, longan, and pumpkin were also added into the porridge. She even packed small porcelain bowls with cartoon characters for Lin Xiaowan.\n\u201cHave you eaten?\u201d Lin Xiaowan asked Huo Zheng.\n\u201cI\u2019ve eaten,\u201d Huo Zheng replied as he peeled a boiled egg for her.\n\nLin Xiaowan ate two mouthfuls of porridge before she blinked and said, \u201cIt\u2019ll be even more delicious if there\u2019s fried dough stick\u2026\u201d\nGu Yuwu laughed at her. \u201cYou\u2019ve already woken up, but you\u2019re still dreaming\u2026\u201d\nLin Xiaowan puffed her cheeks up angrily while Huo Zheng looked at her with a gentle smile on his face.\nLin Xiaowan was not satisfied with just a bowl. She looked at the lunch box eagerly as Huo Zheng put the small bowl away. Clearly, he had no intention of giving her another bowl. She knew she was in the wrong. After all, she did not pay attention to what she ate and fell sick as a result. For this reason, she did not make a fuss and ask for more.\nGu Yuwu leaned against the bed and said to Lin Xiaowan, \u201cI\u2019ll be going to the western suburbs of Shengjing soon. The film studio wants to film a comedy set in ancient times. Do you want to come with me?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan thought Gu Yuwu wanted her to play some role again so she quickly waved her hand and said, \u201cAh, no, no. There\u2019ll be too many people watching me.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not asking you to act. However, you can try on those wide-sleeved costumes for fun if you want\u2026\u201d\nLin Xiaowan was very interested in this. \u201cOh, if that\u2019s the case, it\u2019s fine. Since you\u2019re filming an ancient movie, this means we can take photos of the set as well! Let\u2019s take photos there\u201d\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Gu Yuwu nodded.\nLin Xiaowan had to stay in the hospital for observation.\nSince there was a small kitchen in the suite, Aunt Wu called Huo Zheng, asking if there was a need to send the chef over.\nLin Xiaowan no longer had a fever now. Her stomach still hurt slightly, but the doctor said it was normal. She would be fine after two days.\nHuo Zheng wanted to tell Aunt Wu to send the chef over. After all, in his opinion, it was best for Lin Xiaowan to stay in the hospital for another night just to be sure. However, before he could say anything, Lin Xiaowan quickly said, \u201cNo, no, I\u2019ll go home and eat.\u201d\nIn the end, Huo Zheng spoke to the doctor, and after confirming everything was okay, he brought Lin Xiaowan home.\nWhen they were in the car, Lin Xiaowan saw the dark expression on Huo Zheng\u2019s handsome face. She leaned over and kissed his chin before she asked, amused, \u201cPresident Huo, why are you pulling a long face? Are you angry?\u201d\n\u201cI dare not,\u201d Huo Zheng said as he kissed her. Even if he was angry, it would dissipate when faced with her.\nLin Xiaowan was very sensible at this time. She said, \u201cI was wrong this time. Don\u2019t be angry, okay? 1\u201911 pay attention to what I eat in the future.\u201d\nHuo Zheng said in a low voice, \u201cYou only know how to act cute in times like this\u2026\u201d\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

Aunt Wu said, \u201cI told you weren\u2019t around, but it seemed like she thought that you refused to see her. She tried to call you, but the call didn\u2019t go through. When she left, her expression was not very good.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan had left her phone in the room yesterday since they were in a rush to go to the hospital. Naturally, she could not answer any calls. When she saw the two missed calls on her phone, she felt very resistant about returning the calls. She felt that she would only be looking for trouble if she returned the calls. At the same time, she also felt that it would be rude to ignore the calls.\nWhen Huo Zheng came out of the bathroom, he saw Lin Xiaowan looking at her phone with a troubled expression on her face. He asked, \u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s Lu Yingxin. Do you remember her? She called me, and 1 don\u2019t know if 1 should return her calls.\u201d\n\u201cWho?\u201d Huo Zheng asked.\nLin Xiaowan tilted her head and said, \u201cLu Yingxin. She\u2019s that beautiful woman who visited when we moved in.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan told Huo Zheng about how Lu Yingxin had visited again and how she had run into Lu Yingxin at the dessert shop.\nHuo Zheng shook his head and said, \u201c1 don\u2019t remember her.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan also found out that the man who came with Lu Yingxin that day was staying in Xilin Imperial Garden. After finding out that Huo Zheng had moved to Xilin Imperial Garden, the other party visited, hoping that Huo Zheng would invest in his project. She also found out that Huo Zheng had refused the other party and did not have any interaction with the other party since then. Huo Zheng did not even remember the man\u2019s name.\n\u201cThen why did Lu Yingxin look for me so often?\u201d Lin Xiaowan asked, puzzled.\nAlthough Lin Xiaowan was clueless, Huo Zheng naturally knew that Lu Yingxin had ulterior motives. After thinking about it for a few seconds, he said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to speak to her, then just ignore her. There\u2019s no need to force yourself to cater to others.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlright, 1 understand,\u201d Lin Xiaowan replied.\nIn the end, Lin Xiaowan did not return the calls, and Lu Yingxin did not take the initiative to look for or call Lin Xiaowan again.\nLin Xiaowan assumed the matter would end like this, but after half a month, when Gu Yuwu brought her to the western suburbs, she ran into Lu Yingxin again.\nWhen Lu Yingxin saw Lin Xiaowan, she did not bring up the matter before. Her beautiful face was exquisitely made up, and her smile was bright as she said, \u201cWhat a coincidence. We meet again.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan felt that the world was very small at this moment. She smiled and asked, \u201cAre you filming here? So you\u2019re an actress?\u201d\nLu Yingxin wore a pink dress. Lin Xiaowan did not know if it was the makeup or something else, but she felt that Lu Yingxin looked much more pleasing to the eye than before. To be precise, she did not feel a sense of aversion toward the other party anymore. She said sincerely, \u201cThis style suits you a lot. You look very beautiful.\u201d\nLu Yingxin\u2019s smile widened. \u201cThank you for your compliment.\u201d\nGu Yuwu had just returned from getting the staff member\u2019s pass when she saw Lin Xiaowan talking to Lu Yingxin. She asked, slightly surprised, \u201cYou know her?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan wanted to say no, but Lu Yingxin was faster. She said with a smile, \u201cYes. I just met Miss Lin not too long ago. 1 didn\u2019t expect to meet her here.\u201d\nGu Yuwu did not want to talk to Lu Yingxin anymore so she said, \u201cI think they\u2019re looking for you. You should go over first.\u201d\nAfter Lu Yingxin left, Gu Yuwu hung the staff\u2019s pass around Lin Xiaowan\u2019s neck. Then, she looked in the direction where Lu Yingxin had gone and asked with a hint of disdain, \u201cHow did you meet her?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan could not wait to explore the filming set. She held Gu Yuwu\u2019s hand as they walked. She said, \u201cI think she lives in Xilin Imperial Garden with her boyfriend. When I moved there, she and her boyfriend came to look for Huo Zheng.\u201d\nGu Yuwu rolled her eyes. It was obvious that she did not like Lu Yingxin very much. She said, \u201cHow could she possibly live there?\u201d\nLu Yingxin was just a small celebrity who had participated in a talent show a while ago. However, she was eliminated quite early. Her company did not seem to have any intention of supporting her, and she very quickly found a sugar daddy for herself.\n\nGu Yuwu did not say any unpleasant words to Lin Xiaowan. She only said, \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s her boyfriend. He\u2019s just an\u2026 investor. She probably found a \u2018way\u2019 for herself\u2026\u201d\nAlthough Gu Yuwu\u2019s words were vague, Lin Xiaowan understood them. She was not a fool after all. She was slightly shocked. \u201cOh, so that\u2019s the case\u2026\u201d\nThen, Lin Xiaowan asked curiously, \u201cYou don\u2019t seem to like her very much. What\u2019s wrong? Is her acting bad?\u201d\nGu Yuwu had a headache when she heard this. \u201cHow should I put it? Although she used her connections to get this role, her acting skills are not bad. 1 heard that she took acting classes before this so her skills barely passed. She\u2019s just a supporting actress so she doesn\u2019t have many scenes. Moreover, to be honest, she\u2019s quite hardworking. She\u2019s not a burden to the team. She\u2019s also very good with her words and knows how to do things\u2026\u201d\n\u201cHowever, after observing her for a few days, I feel that she\u2019s a little\u2026\u201d\nGu Yuwu thought about it for a moment before she said, \u201cI feel she\u2019s a little too fake\u2026\u201d\nLin Xiaowan\u2019s ears perked up immediately. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s like she\u2019s wearing a mask. Although she smiles at everyone, it doesn\u2019t feel real\u2026\u201d\nLin Xiaowan nodded vigorously in agreement and said in a low voice, \u201cI feel the same way! When I first met her, I was actually a little repulsed by her. I felt that what she said was different from what she thought\u2026 It\u2019s really strange. It\u2019s not like I know what she\u2019s thinking, but 1 just have this gut feeling\u2026\u201d\nLin Xiaowan sighed and continued to say, \u201cI saw a video two days ago. It said that people have magnetic fields, and sometimes they repel each other. Perhaps our magnetic fields repel each other so 1 feel a sense of repulsion toward her.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps that\u2019s the case\u2026\u201d\nGu Yuwu did not say anything more. Lu Yingxin\u2019s performance was actually quite good. She did not act ostentatiously, and she was also hardworking. Although she did not have many scenes, she would sit and watch others act when she had the time, learning from others.\n\u2018Perhaps our magnetic fields just repel each other\u2026\u2019\n\u201cAlright, let\u2019s not talk about her anymore. When you\u2019re done looking around, 1\u201911 bring you to look at the costumes. The quality of the costumes this time is very good. The designer we found is very skilled. The clothes are all exquisite. You\u2019ll definitely like them.\u201d\n\u201cOkay. This place is perfect for painting. The scenery is so good. I\u2019ll bring my sketch pad tomorrow and paint something for you, okay?\u201d\nRecently, she did not have any lessons with Hong Minhua. However, when she encountered problems, she would still ask Hong Minhua for advice.

She also brought her sketchpad to Gu Yuwu\u2019s lounge. She would draw when she was inspired. When she was not, she would take photos.\nGu Yuwu had also been taking a lot of photos. She had not updated her Bobo Star account since the new year. Since she had taken many photos of Lin Xiaowan, she asked if she could upload them.\nLin Xiaowan had been wearing wide-sleeved dresses, and she was very satisfied with them. She was also satisfied with the photos. It was not the first time her face was exposed on the Internet, and she was no longer afraid of people talking about her. As such, after only a brief moment of hesitation, she agreed.\nAfter agreeing, an idea appeared in Lin Xiaowan\u2019s mind. She said, \u201cThere are period costumes for men too. 1 wonder if Huo Zheng would take a photo with me? Look at the stone bridge over there. Imagine if 1 held an umbrella and walked past him. Wow, what a fateful scene. It\u2019d make for a good photo!\u201d\nThe more Lin Xiaowan thought about it, the more excited she became.\nGu Yuwu did not know whether to laugh or cry when she heard these words. She said, \u201cDon\u2019t make things difficult for your President Huo.\u201d\nThey were on set, after all. If someone of Huo Zheng\u2019s status came, and the filming crew found out about it, they might not only make a big fuss, but they might even cause trouble.\n\u201cWhat do you mean by making things difficult?\u201d\nGu Yuwu said, \u201cNext time, I\u2019ll take photos of both of you. There are too many people here. If the two of you take photos here, it\u2019ll cause too much of a commotion. It\u2019s fine to take photos of you alone, but if you invite your President Huo here, there\u2019ll be people crowding around you no matter where you go.\u201d\nThere were a lot of people in the filming crew. No matter where they went, there would be no peace.\nLin Xiaowan thought about it and agreed with Gu Yuwu. If Huo Zheng came, he probably would not be happy as well. Finally, she said, \u201cAlright, forget it then.\u201d\nAt dusk, the weather was extremely good. Colorful clouds could be seen in the sky at this moment.\nThe crew would be filming a big scene with a lot of people, and Gu Yuwu asked Lin Xiaowan if she wanted to be an extra in the crowd.\nLin Xiaowan asked, \u201cWhat do I have to do?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be playing a palace maid, and all you have to do is stand in the crowd. You don\u2019t have any lines, and the camera won\u2019t be focused on you.\u201d\n\nWith that, Lin Xiaowan became the palace maid of an Imperial Concubine.\nThe scene was set at a grand banquet. There were many people present. Rows of tables laden with food had been set up beforehand. The food was ancient cuisine that had been carefully prepared by those who studied it. Every one of them was exquisite.\nLin Xiaowan wondered how the food tasted. During her break, she took photos of what she thought would be delicious and sent them to Huo Zheng.\nWhen Huo Zheng got off work after listening to a report, he looked at his phone and found that he had over 30 photos of all kinds of dishes. Before he could ask about them, Lin Xiaowan sent him a message.\n[Lin Xiaowan; The food looks so delicious!]\nAfter that, she sent a photo of herself along with a message.\n[Lin Xiaowan: Today, I\u2019m the palace maid of an Imperial Concubine-]\nThe filming ended when it was dark.\nLin Xiaowan had grown tired from listening to the actors reciting their lines.\nGu Yuwu came over as soon as filming ended and asked, \u201cAre you hungry? It\u2019s already so late.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan sighed. \u201cI wasn\u2019t very hungry at first. However, looking at all the delicious dishes on the table, 1 became hungry\u2026\u201d\nGu Yuwu brought Lin Xiaowan to the changing room and said, \u201cLet\u2019s change your clothes. I\u2019ll take you out for dinner.\u201d\nThen, she looked at Lin Xiaowan\u2019s face for a moment before she asked, \u201cDid the makeup artist touch up your makeup?\u201d\n\u201cYes. The actress playing the Imperial Concubine even gave me peanuts and almond crisps to eat! They\u2019re delicious.\u201d\nGu Yuwu smiled. \u201cThat actress is a good person. She has a good personality. I\u2019ve known her for a few years. If you like her, you can have dinner with her in the future. She likes good girls like you.\u201d\nAfter changing her clothes, Lin Xiaowan sent another message to Huo Zheng, saying that she would not be going home for dinner. Then, she asked Gu Yuwu, \u201cHow did you get here today? Are we eating somewhere nearby, or are we driving? The driver sent me here today, and he\u2019s waiting for me.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll take you to a small restaurant nearby. It\u2019s owned by a couple, and it\u2019s been around for a long time. The food there is really delicious.\u201d\nThe two women walked to the restaurant instead of taking the car, which was parked a small distance away. After all, they were at a filming set, and the car could not be simply parked.\n\nBefore the two women finished eating, it rained unexpectedly.\nOriginally, they were going to film a night scene at the market where there would be a dragon and lion dance. It was a very lively scene. Seeing that the weather was very good in the evening, everyone assumed the weather would be good at night. Unexpectedly, it rained.\nThe spring rain was not heavy, it was just a drizzle. However, whether the rain was heavy or not, they would not be able to film tonight.\nGu Yuwu felt a little regretful after she received the call from the director informing her that filming had been canceled. She said, \u201cFilming has been canceled. You won\u2019t be able to see the dragon and lion dance you\u2019ve been looking forward to\u2026\u201d\nThe last time Lin Xiaowan had seen a dragon and lion dance was when she was young. Many years had passed, and she had not seen it again. As such, she was looking forward to seeing it tonight. She asked, \u201cThen are they filming that scene tomorrow night? If they are, let me know. I want to see it.\u201d\nGu Yuwu smiled. \u201cAlright, alright. I\u2019ll let you know when the time comes. I\u2019ll let you be an extra so you\u2019ll have a clear view of the dragon and lion dance.\u201d\nAt this moment, Huo Zheng called.\n\u201cIt\u2019s raining. Where are you?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m eating with Sister Yuwu. Have you eaten?\u201d Lin Xiaowan asked.\n\u201cI\u2019ve eaten,\u201d Huo Zheng replied before asking again, \u201cDid you bring an umbrella?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan looked outside the window before she replied, \u201cNo. It wasn\u2019t raining when we came out. However, it\u2019s only drizzling. It\u2019s fine even if 1 don\u2019t have an umbrella. Moreover, I\u2019m wearing a coat and a hat today.\u201d\nHuo Zheng\u2019s voice turned a little serious as he said, \u201cYou were sick not long ago, but you seemed to have forgotten about it. Get the driver to pick you up at the entrance.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan stuck out her tongue and said, \u201cAlright, alright.\u201d\nHowever, despite her words, Lin Xiaowan did not call for the driver to pick her up. After dinner, she held Gu Yuwu\u2019s hand and ran back. She said happily, \u201cWow, this feels like the time when I was still studying and 1 had to brave the rain after class\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI remember Sister Qiao said that you studied at a university in Shengjing?\u201d Gu Yuwu asked.\nLin Xiaowan nodded. She felt a little embarrassed when this matter was mentioned. She said, \u201cWhen 1 took the college entrance examination, there was a change in the system. The cutoff score was especially low so I was accepted into the university.\u201d\nAt that time, the country separated liberal arts and sciences. Not only that, but the country also changed the scoring system. These changes were all beneficial to Lin Xiaowan.\nThe rain was very light. The two women ran and quickly arrived back on set.\nGu Yuwu looked at Lin Xiaowan. The latter\u2019s coat was slightly damp, but she wore a hat so her hair was dry. After a moment, she said, \u201cI\u2019ll get you an anti-cold medicine. Eat it before you leave..\u201d\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

However, when she saw Lin Xiaowan, her expression became a little unnatural. Following that, she quickly calmed down, no longer looking as excited as she did before. Nonetheless, she still could not hide that she was in a good mood. She asked, \u201cSister Gu, Xiaowan, you haven\u2019t left yet?\u201d\nOver the past few days, Lin Xiaowan often saw Lu Yingxin on set. Occasionally, they would greet each other. They could not be considered close, but their relationship was much better than before when Lin Xiaowan kept avoiding Lu Yingxin.\nLin Xiaowan said, \u201c1 was having dinner with Sister Yuwu earlier. I\u2019m leaving soon.\u201d Then, she asked, \u201cYou look happy. Did something happen?\u201d\nLu Yingxin laughed. \u201cI don\u2019t know yet. After all, it\u2019s not been confirmed. Once it\u2019s confirmed, I\u2019ll share the good news with you!\u201d\nAfter a short conversation, Lin Xiaowan and Gu Yuwu resumed their journey back to the lounge. As soon as they opened the door, they saw Huo Zheng, who was dressed in a suit, sitting on the couch and waiting for Lin Xiaowan.\n\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d Lin Xiaowan asked, slightly surprised.\n\u201cI came to pick you up.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan was wearing a khaki-colored coat today. As such, the wet marks were very obvious. With just a glance, Huo Zheng knew that she did not ask the driver to pick her up. Sometimes he would have a headache when his words went in her left ear and out of her right ear. He sighed and asked, \u201cWhat did you promise me over the phone earlier, huh?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan said shamelessly, \u201cI forgot.\u201d\nHuo Zheng took off his suit jacket and put it on her. Then, he tapped the tip of her nose and said, \u201cIf you fall sick again, you\u2019re not allowed to cling to me and act cute.\u201d\nGu Yuwu handed Lin Xiaowan the medicine to prevent a cold as she asked casually, \u201cPresident Huo, how did you find my lounge? You came all the way here, and no one stopped you or asked any questions? This isn\u2019t a place where people can come as they please after all\u2026\u201d\nHuo Zheng looked at Lin Xiaowan as she took the medicine, saying, \u201cA staff member brought me here. The people here are very enthusiastic.\u201d\n\nThe journey to Gu Yuwu\u2019s lounge was not long. The person who had brought him here tried her best to find a topic to talk about with him. Even if he did not respond to her, she would continue talking on her own. In the beginning, he thought the other party knew him, but after observing the other party for a while, he dismissed that thought. He assumed the other party was just naturally enthusiastic and friendly.\nThe filming crew was staying in a hotel near the filming set. Although filming had been canceled, it was normal for staff members to be busy on set. For this reason, Gu Yuwu did not find Huo Zheng\u2019s words strange. As she packed her things, she said, \u201cPresident Huo, you look noble, after all. With just a glance, people can tell you\u2019re not ordinary. It\u2019s only normal for people to want to get close to you.\u201d\nAt this moment, Gu Yuwu suddenly paused when a thought appeared in her mind. Then, she asked tentatively, \u201cDo you still remember what the staff member who led you here wore?\u201d\n\u201c1 didn\u2019t pay attention. 1 think she was wearing a baseball jacket. Her hairstyle is like those from ancient times,\u201d Huo Zheng replied. Then, he asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\nGu Yuwu recalled what Lu Yingxin wore earlier when they ran into her. Lu Yingxin was wearing a baseball jacket, and her hairstyle was still from when she was filming. She said, \u201cThat\u2019s Lu Yingxin.\u201d\n\u201cWho?\u201d Huo Zheng frowned, puzzled.\nAt this time, Lin Xiaowan chimed in, \u201cLu Yingxin?\u201d Then, she asked Huo Zheng, \u201cYou didn\u2019t recognize her? You met her at the gate of our house previously. She\u2019s the person 1 told you about previously.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t remember her.\u201d\nHuo Zheng had to meet a lot of people every day. Moreover, he did not pay attention to Lu Yingxin when they met previously. Not only that, but Lu Yingxin had also put on makeup tonight.\nGu Yuwu muttered to herself, \u201cI keep feeling like something\u2019s not right. How did she meet you?\u201d\nPerhaps it was a coincidence. When Huo Zheng arrived, he had come in with an umbrella. The driver waited for him in the car. As soon as he walked in, he saw Lu Yingxin. Based on her hairstyle, he assumed that she was part of the crew and would know where Gu Yuwu\u2019s lounge was so he asked her about it.\nLin Xiaowan did not take this matter to heart. She said, \u201cIt\u2019s probably just a coincidence. 1 saw her a lot during the past few days I was here. There\u2019s nothing strange about it. Moreover, her attitude is quite good. In any case, there\u2019s no need to pay attention to such a small matter. Let\u2019s go!\u201d\nGu Yuwu still had something to do so she did not leave with them.\nThe rain outside was getting heavier.\nHuo Zheng held the umbrella with one hand and wrapped the other around Lin Xiaowan\u2019s waist as they walked toward the car. He said, a little dissatisfied, \u201cBe careful not to step into a puddle. If you wet your shoes, you\u2019ll feel uncomfortable. I haven\u2019t been keeping an eye on you recently. Why do you look thinner? Have you not been eating well outside?\u201d\nLin Xiawaon glared at him and complained, \u201cYou\u2019re spouting nonsense. How could I lose weight in just a few days? 1 even weighed myself yesterday. My weight is the same. Don\u2019t wrongly accuse me!\u201d\n\n\u201cYour weight is the same? Then not gaining weight is the same as losing weight,\u201d Huo Zheng said with a straight face.\n\u201cWhat nonsense are you spouting?\u201d Lin Xiaowan said. Then, she deliberately stepped on a small puddle of water, splashing water on Huo Zheng\u2019s leather shoes.\nHuo Zheng patted her waist and asked, \u201cAre you losing your temper?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan only scoffed in response.\nIt was a little windy at night so Huo Zheng tilted the umbrella before he asked, \u201cThe rain is getting heavier, and it\u2019s late now. Should we just stay here for the night?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan was not particular about where she slept so she agreed. \u201cOkay, then tell the driver who brought me here to stay the night as well. It\u2019s quite far for him to drive back.\u201d\n\u201cOkay.\u201d\nAs they got closer and closer to the main road, Lin Xiaowan\u2019s sharp eyes noticed that not far from where Huo Zheng parked the car, a person stood under a parasol tree with her back facing them. She said, \u201cThat seems to be Lu Yingxin\u2026\u201d\nHuo Zheng did not respond.\nAs the duo approached, Lu Yingxin heard the sound of footsteps. When she turned around, she saw two people sharing an umbrella.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really you! I was wondering if it was you. Why are you here? You didn\u2019t bring your umbrella?\u201d Lin Xiaowan asked. She knew there were always umbrellas in the car so she added, \u201cWe have an extra umbrella in the car. Let me get it for you.\u201d\nLu Yingxi lowered her head slightly. Her long hair was damped and tucked behind her ears. She raised her eyes, looking pitiful and slightly embarrassed to be seen in such a sorry state, and said, \u201cNo need, no need. I\u2019m actually trying to hail a cab. 1 didn\u2019t expect it to be so difficult to find a cab here. I\u2019ve been waiting for ten minutes, but I\u2019ve not seen a cab at all.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan looked at the pitiful Lu Yingxin before she looked at Huo Zheng. She could not help but pity Lu Yingxin a little, but she felt that it was difficult for her to decide if they should give Lu Yingxin a ride.\nSeeing that the couple was silent, Lu Yingxin asked tentatively, \u201cXiaowan, if it\u2019s convenient for you, can you give me a ride? You can drop me off at a busier intersection.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan looked at Huo Zheng, asking silently with her eyes, \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d\nAfter a moment, three people got into the car.\nLin Xiaowan handed Lu Yingxin some tissue paper and said, \u201cWipe your face first.\u201d\nThen, she poured a glass of warm water from the dispenser in the car and handed it to Lu Yingxin as she said, \u201cIt\u2019s really not easy to get a cab when the weather is bad..\u201d\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

The spacious and expensive care made her even more envious of Lin Xiaowan\u2019s life.\nLin Xiaowan asked, \u201cWhere do you live?\u201d\nAt this time, Lin Xiaowan recalled Gu Yuwu\u2019s words. Previously, Gu Yuwu had said that it was unlikely that Lu Yingxin was staying in Xilin Imperial Garden. As such, she subconsciously asked, \u201cAre you also staying in Xilin Imperial Garden?\u201d\nLu Yingxin wiped the rain off her face and nodded. \u201cYes, but I\u2019m not staying there today. Just drop me off at an intersection. 1 need to get something from another house.\u201d\nLu Yingxin was naturally lying. It was difficult to buy a house in Xilin Imperial Garden. She had neither money nor status so how could she stay there? She had only stayed there twice, and even then, she had to beg Old Master Li to let her do so. She deliberately lied to Lin Xiaowan to increase her value and also to satisfy her own vanity.\nLu Yingxin had long figured out that most of the people staying in Xilin Imperial did not know their neighbors. The houses were far apart, and the privacy was very good.\nAs expected, Lin Xiaowan did not notice that Lu Yingxin was lying. She nodded and said, \u201cAlright, let the driver send you to your destination. We\u2019re staying in a hotel nearby tonight so we won\u2019t be with you\u2026 There\u2019s an umbrella here. Remember to take it with you if it\u2019s still raining.\u201d\nInitially, Lin Xiaowan planned to ask the driver to stay in the hotel as well. However, since they gave Lu Yingxin a ride, she did not think it was appropriate to drop Lu Yingxin off at the intersection when it was raining. At the same time, she also planned to speak to the driver alone later. She wanted to tell the driver that if the rain was too heavy, just send Lu Yingxin to a nearby hotel and that he could also stay at the hotel.\nWhen the car pulled up to the entrance of the hotel, the rain had gotten heavier. The sky was pitch-black, and it was extremely windy.\n\nSeeing this, Lu Yingxin seemed to have found another excuse for herself. She wanted to see if she could obtain a free room for herself before the couple got out of the car. She said, feigning a considerate tone, \u201cI can get off here. I should be able to get a cab nearby. There\u2019s no need to trouble the driver to send me off. It\u2019s too troublesome. Moreover, the weather is bad now. It\u2019s not safe to drive.\u201d\nAs she spoke, Lu Yingxin pretended to open the door. However, the expensive car\u2019s door handle had rows of buttons on them. Although there were symbols on the button, she really could not figure out which one would open the door.\nLin Xiaowan noticed Lu Yingxin\u2019s helplessness and quickly pulled the other party back. \u201cNo, how can 1 let you go on your own? What do you need to get from your house? Is it important? If it\u2019s not, why don\u2019t you stay here for the night?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan had seen the weather forecast so she knew the rain was only going to get heavier.\nLu Yingxin naturally knew how to seize the opportunity. Although she could not wait to agree, she hid her enthusiasm. She only said, \u201cIt\u2019s not important.\u201d After all, it was just an excuse.\nLu Yingxin pretended to look troubled as she said, \u201cHowever, I don\u2019t think this suggestion is feasible. I didn\u2019t bring my identity card with me. 1 need my identity card to book a room, right?\u201d\n\u201cOh, you can use the electronic identity card on your phone,\u201d Lin Xiaowan said.\nWith this, Lu Yingxin no longer feigned reluctance and agreed immediately. She was extremely happy at this moment, but she pretended to be very embarrassed for having to trouble Lin Xiaowan. She even said that she wanted to treat Lin Xiaowan to a meal to thank Lin Xiaowan. She did not forget to say that she hoped Lin Xiaowan would not refuse her.\nWhen the doorman opened the car door, Huo Zheng got out of the car first. Then, he tightened Lin Xiaowan\u2019s coat as he said, \u201cBe careful not to catch a cold\u2026\u201d\n\u201cOkay.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan held Huo Zheng\u2019s hand. At this moment, he was only wearing a shirt; his suit jacket had been given to Lin Xiaowan. Seeing this, she said softly, \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t catch a cold either\u2026\u201d\nLu Yingxin, who was following two steps behind the duo, finally dared to size Huo Zheng up. She looked at his tall figure and handsome side profile, thinking that he was really the man of her dreams.\n\nAfter Lu Yingxin entered the room, she threw herself on the small couch. She thought about Huo Zheng\u2019s deep and sexy voice and the way he silently walked next to her when she led him to Gu Yuwu\u2019s lounge. She could not help but giggle. It was as though she could already see herself dating him.\nShe brought her phone out and saw that there were dozens of messages in a six-person group chat. Feeling satisfied, she quickly reported to her best friends about her encounter tonight.\nIn fact, it was not a coincidence that Lu Yingxin met Huo Zheng on set earlier. It was also not a coincidence that she was standing under the rain near his car. She naturally did not know that Huo Zheng would come to the filming set, but she found out from the security at the entrance of Xilin Imperial Garden that Huo Zheng\u2019s car had left shortly after returning. Considering the bad weather and the fact that Lin Xiaowan was still on set, she boldly speculated that Huo Zheng was coming to pick Lin Xiaowan up.\nSeeing that there was no harm in waiting to confirm her guess, she pretended to play with her phone as she stood near the entrance of the filming set. She was worried that Huo Zheng would ignore her, but fortunately, no one was around due to the bad weather. As such, he had no choice but to ask her for directions.\nBefore she waited for Huo Zheng, Lu Yingxin had also considered all possibilities. If someone asked her why she was standing alone, she would say that she was waiting for someone. However, if Huo Zheng came and ignored her, she would pretend to be an enthusiastic staff member and ask him if he was looking for someone. However, it seemed like luck was on her side tonight. Huo Zheng actually approached her to ask for directions.\nHuo Zheng had no intention of chatting with her at all. Although she tried her best to find a topic to talk about, he ignored her completely. When they arrived, he only thanked her politely.\nAfter that, Lu Yingxin planned to leave, satisfied with her gains for tonight. However, when she walked to the main road, she recognized Huo Zheng\u2019s car and license plate number. With that, she changed her mind. It did not matter if she had to stand in the rain if it meant she could get to know Huo Zheng and leave an impression on him. As long as she managed to leave an impression on him, she was confident that she could approach Huo Zheng step by step.\nAfter a while, Lu Yingxin called room service and ordered a cup of brown sugar ginger tea. She did not forget to order some for Huo Zheng and Lin Xiaowan as well. She wanted to use this opportunity to cement her image as a considerate and thoughtful person.\nAlas, imagination had always been much more beautiful than reality.\nIn reality, as soon as Lu Yingxin stepped out of the elevator and the elevator door closed, Huo Zheng said to Lin Xiaowan, \u201cStay away from that person in the future.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan was confused. \u201cWhy?\u201d\nThen, she added, \u201cIn fact, we\u2019re not very close. It\u2019s just that I see her a lot recently on set so we\u2019re just a little more familiar with each other..\u201d\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

At that time, Huo Zheng had sensed that something was wrong so he asked his assistant to investigate Lu Yingxin. Later on, when his assistant was reporting the results of the investigation to him, his assistant had mentioned Lu Yingxin\u2019s relationship with Old Master Li.\nLu Yingxin could not even be considered a lover of Old Master Li. Their relationship was purely a transaction. One gave money and resources while the other sold herself.\nHuo Zheng also knew the other party did not live in Xilin Imperial Garden. Old Master Li had provided her with a house in another high-end neighborhood.\nUnfortunately, Huo Zheng did not recognize Lu Yingxin. Otherwise, he would not have had any interaction with her at all earlier.\nHowever, it had to be said that the results of the investigation did not have any issues related to Lu Yingxin\u2019s character or morals. Moreover, her background was quite clean, and she graduated from a famous university.\nDespite that, Huo Zheng was still prejudiced against Lu Yingxin. In any case, he did not plan to tell Lin Xiaowan about these things since it would only make her feel troubled.\n\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. Most people in the entertainment industry are not simple. It\u2019s best not to get close to them. When you make friends, you have to be discerning. Do you understand?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan nodded in agreement. She knew that the entertainment industry was chaotic. Although she did not pay much attention to celebrities, she had seen quite a few ridiculous headlines about celebrities.\nAs soon as they entered the room, Huo Zheng urged her to take a hot shower.\nShe did not bring a change of clothes or pajamas with her, and Huo Zheng did not want her to wear the hotel\u2019s robe. As such, he called the concierge and asked for someone to buy them for her.\nMeanwhile, Lin Xiaowan had just hung up her clothes when an idea appeared in her head. She walked over to Huo Zheng who was running a bath for her before she hugged his waist. Then, she deliberately said in a delicate and pretentious voice, \u201cPresident Huo, I really didn\u2019t mean to come into your room! Please let me go!\u201d\nHuo Zheng glanced at the hands around his waist and gulped. Then, he said cooperatively, \u201cNo. Who knows if you did it intentionally?\u201d\nSeeing that he was cooperating with her act, she grew even more enthusiastic. She moved closer and said, \u201cPresident Huo, what must 1 do before you\u2019ll let me leave?\u201d\nHuo Zheng felt his blood surge seeing the woman in front of him enthusiastically role-playing. He pulled her into his arms and said, \u201cWhat?\n\nDidn\u2019t you think of the consequences before entering my room?\u201d\n\u201cNo, don\u2019t do that! I, I have someone 1 like. President Huo, please don\u2019t do this,\u201d Lin Xiaowan said, pretending to struggle and refuse. She pretended to cry, but she could not hide the smile on her face at all. She was clearly enjoying herself.\n\u201cSomeone you like? Who do you like?\u201d Huo Zheng asked. He said these lines smoothly as though he had heard them before. He trapped her with one arm while he lifted her chin with his other hand before he continued to say, \u201cYou can only like me.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan could not help but laugh out loud. She wrapped her arms around him and kissed his throat before she said, \u201cActually, I\u2019ve liked you for a long time. I was afraid that you wouldn\u2019t like me so 1 came up with this plan. I\u2026\u201d\nBefore she could finish her words, Huo Zheng, who could no longer endure it, grabbed the back of her head and kissed her hard.\nLin Xiaowan was kissed until she was out of breath. She gripped the front of his shirt tightly, and her body leaned against his softly. When she regained her senses, she was already sitting on his lap.\nHuo Zheng\u2019s hands moved around her body as he kissed her ear. A teasing smile could be seen on his face as he whispered in a low and hoarse voice, \u201cYou\u2019re getting bolder.\u201d\nSuddenly, the doorbell rang.\nWith that, Huo Zheng forced himself to calm down. He quickly carried her into the bathtub and said, \u201cSoak in there for a while.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan\u2019s skin was slightly red. Her face was also red, and her eyes were slightly teary from being kissed so hard. As she sat in the bathtub and looked at him expectantly, Huo Zheng felt like he was going to die, and it took a lot of effort for him to walk away.\nInitially, Huo Zheng thought that the hotel had sent someone to bring the new clothes over. To his surprise, it was room service. The hotel employee had brought a pot of brown sugar ginger tea.\n\u201cHello, Mr. Huo. Miss Lu from Room 1104 ordered a pot of brown sugar ginger tea and told us to send it to your room.\u201d\nHuo Zheng\u2019s face was expressionless. He placed the pot of tea on the cabinet near the entrance. He had no intention of letting Lin Xiaowan drink it. However, after taking two steps, he paused. He lifted the lid of the pot and saw that there was also poached egg in the brown sugar ginger tea. Thinking that the tea had been sent to the room directly from the kitchen and that Lu Yingxin had no contact with it at all, he decided to let Lin Xiaowan drink it. After all, it could indeed ward off the cold. There was no harm in giving her some.\nWith this, Huo Zheng brought the pot of tea to the bar and kept it warm.\nAt this time, the doorbell rang again. This time, another hotel employee came to deliver the clothes.\nWhen Huo Zheng finally returned to the bathroom, Lin Xiaowan was about to fall asleep. She asked sleepily, \u201cThe clothes are here?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\nAfter placing the clothes in the disinfection cabinet, Huo Zheng walked over. Looking at the yawning Lin Xiaowan, he asked, \u201cAre you sleepy?\u201d\n\u201cNot really. It\u2019s just that you were gone for a long time, and I was bored.\u201d\nHuo Zheng smiled slightly. After he stepped into the bathtub, he dropped a kiss on her neck and said, \u201cYou won\u2019t be bored now\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWait\u2026 We\u2019re still in the bathtub\u2026\u201d\nHe held her waist and pulled her into his arms as he said, \u201cIt\u2019s fine\u2026\u201d\nShe held onto his arms, and her knuckles turned white from the force.\nAll in all, Huo Zheng was very satisfied with their bath.\nWhen everything was said and done, Huo Zheng helped Lin Xiaowan put on her pajamas before he carried her to the bed. She leaned against him softly and quietly. Seeing how cute she was, he lowered his head and kissed her again.\nAt the same time, Lin Xiaowan smelled a sweet fragrance in the air. She asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s that smell? Did you buy something delicious?\u201d\n\u201cLu Yingxin sent a pot of brown sugar ginger tea over. Do you want to drink it in bed or in the living room?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan decisively chose to stay in bed. As soon as Huo Zheng placed her on the bed, she sighed comfortably. Then, she complained, \u201cMy knees and waist hurt\u2026\u201d\nThe surface of the porcelain bathtub was hard after all.\n\u201cI\u2019ll massage them for you later\u2026\u201d\nHuo Zheng hugged and coaxed her for a while before she finally stopped complaining. After that, he heated the brown sugar ginger tea before bringing it to Lin Xiaowan.\nLin Xiaowan listened to the sound outside and said, \u201cIt\u2019s still raining, and the wind is really strong. Previously, when the weather was bad, Little Chestnut would sleep with us. 1 wonder if she\u2019ll look for Aunt Wu tonight.\u201d\nLittle Chestnut was very clingy with Lin Xiaowan. If Lin Xiaowan was not around, it would look for Huo Zheng. Only if the two of them were not around would it look for another person.\n\u201cEat the poached egg as well,\u201d Huo Zheng said. At the same time, he sat on the edge of the bed and massaged her knees slowly. He did not forget to say, \u201cYour feet are sticking out of the blanket again. You have to keep them warm.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan did not pay attention to his words at all. She held the small bowl and brought the poached egg to her mouth. Then, she said, \u201cThere are two of them. I\u2019ll give you one..\u201d\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

With that, the night filming also resumed.\nIn the afternoon, Gu Yuwu called Lin Xiaowan.\n\u201cHello, beautiful! Do you want to watch the dragon and lion dance tonight?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan replied happily, \u201cYes, yes! When will you start filming? Should I come over now?\u201d\n\u201cYou can come now. It\u2019s quite hot now, but it\u2019ll be cold at night. Remember to bring a jacket,\u201d Gu Yuwu said, \u201cLet me know when you\u2019re at the entrance. I\u2019ll come out and pick you up.\u201d\nWhen the two women met, Lin Xiaowan exclaimed, \u201cWow! Why did you change into the costume as well? Do you have a role as well?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll be an extra with you. Why? Don\u2019t you want to be with me?\u201d Gu Yuwu said teasingly.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t say that, Don\u2019t simply accuse me!\u201d\nAs Gu Yuwu led Lin Xiaowan in, she said, \u201cLater on, we\u2019ll film the night scene on the other side of the street. They\u2019re packing up over there and filming other scenes first. I\u2019ll bring you to change your clothes first.\u201d\nThe weather at night was good. The moon was bright, and the stars dotted the sky. After the heavy rain the night before, the temperature also rose. There was only a slight breeze.\nThe street was lined with strings of red lanterns. The extras were walking around the street. Some of them were pedestrians, and some of them were vendors hawking goods at the side of the street. The scene was very lively.\nThe scenes were filmed separately. With the actors and the staff members present, it was even more lively. It was as though it was really the Lantern Festival.\nLin Xiaowan\u2019s hair was long, and it was tied into two cute buns. She wore a gray dress. At this time, she was looking at exquisite and beautiful lanterns with Gu Yuwu. Some of them had a riddle on them.\nGu Yuwu picked a bunny lantern for Lin Xiaowan.\n\nLin Xiaowan held it and looked at the warm yellow light excitedly. Although she liked it a lot, she asked worriedly, \u201cIs it okay for us to just take it away? Do we have to pay for it?\u201d\nGu Yuwu laughed, amused. \u201cThey\u2019re all props. There\u2019s no need to pay for it.\u201d\nWith that, Lin Xiaowan carried the lantern around happily.\nWhen the scene of the dragon and lion dance was about to be filmed, the extras gathered and several of them cheered loudly.\nAt this time, Lin Xiaowan saw an extra who was also playing a palace maid, holding a piece of osmanthus cake. The other party even gave her a slice of cake.\nLin Xiaowan had no resistance toward food. After eating, she was not satisfied. She asked, \u201cWhere did you get this? Did you order it? I want more. It\u2019s warm and delicious.\u201d\nThe extra laughed and said, \u201cNo. We\u2019re filming a scene at the night market. There are so many stalls here. Some of the food is fake, but some is real. I asked for this at the bridge over there. They won\u2019t eat it after filming. It\u2019s a waste not to eat it now.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan made a mental note of this, planning to have a look later.\nThe dragon and lion dance was not as simple as Lin Xiaowan thought. There were many characters present so the dance could not be filmed in one shot. Hence, the dance was frequently interrupted.\nAfter a while, Lin Xiaowan lost interest. She tilted her head and asked Gu Yuwu softly, \u201cSister, do we have to wait until they\u2019re done filming before we can leave?\u201d\nGu Yuwu asked, \u201cYou don\u2019t want to watch anymore? There\u2019s no need for us to wait. We\u2019re just extras after all. It doesn\u2019t matter if we\u2019re here or not. With so many people, no one would be able to tell even if we\u2019re absent.\u201d\nThey were not standing in an obvious position, to begin with. With that, Gu Yuwu led Lin Xiaowan away.\nLin Xiaowan asked curiously, \u201cThere are so many extras here. Do you think some of them will sneak away like us?\u201d\nGu Yuwu had never thought about this before. She said, \u201cI don\u2019t think so. It\u2019s not like the extras came to perform for free. They\u2019re paid for this. I remember all the scenes you acted in so you\u2019ll be paid as well. When everything is done, I\u2019ll transfer the money to you. In any case, I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll sneak away. After all, they won\u2019t be paid if they sneak away.\u201d\n\u201cI see.\u201d\nGu Yuwu continued to say, \u201cMoreover, many extras like acting and want to be celebrities. Even if the cameras briefly sweep over them, they\u2019ll feel proud when they see their faces in the movies or dramas.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan nodded. \u201cThat makes sense.\u201d\n\nThen, she suggested, \u201cLet\u2019s go to that stall to see if there are any more cakes.\u201d\nAn I-knew-it expression on Gu Yuwu\u2019s face immediately upon hearing these words. She laughed and said, \u201cThis is not a real night market. The pastries are also props. However, if you want to eat them, I\u2019ll get some for you.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan really liked the set of the streets in ancient times. Some places were empty since they were not being used for filming at the moment. It made them very suitable for taking photos.\n\u201cThis place is really suitable for taking photos. Will they demolish the set after they\u2019re done filming?\u201d\nSeeing that Lin Xiaowan was interested, Gu Yuwu said, \u201cPhones can take good photos as well. Do you want me to take a few photos for you?\u201d\nGu Yuwu was very good at photography. No matter what equipment she used, the final work would still be stunning.\n\u201cOkay!\u201d\nLin Xiaowan did not like being in front of the camera. In the past, she would avoid cameras. Let alone cameras, she would even avoid meeting people\u2019s eyes. However, unknowingly, at some point, she began to like seeing different versions of herself in photos. Now, when she talked to people, she could also look them in the eyes. Perhaps the people around her were always encouraging her with kind words, she slowly became more and more confident.\nThey had just taken a few photos when a staff member saw Gu Yuwu and ran over. \u201cSister Gu, you\u2019re here. I have something to discuss with you about the props. Are you free now?\u201d\nIn a few days, they would be filming a riding scene in the grassland. However, there were some problems with the props. Gu Yuwu knew about this as well. After the staff member finished speaking, she looked at Lin Xiaowan and asked, \u201cI have something to deal with. Do you want to come with me, or do you want to look around on your own for a while?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll just look around on my own\u2026\u201d\n\u201cAlright. The staff members are nearby anyway. Did you bring your phone? If you can\u2019t find your way back to my lounge, call me, or get someone to bring you there,\u201d Gu Yuwu said, looking like a worried parent.\n\u201cI know, I know.\u201d\nAfter Gu Yuwu left, Lin Xiaowan walked around on her own. She looked at the props curiously.\nAt this moment, a staff member was pushing a small wheelbarrow. His head was lowered, and he was looking to the right. As such, he did not notice Lin Xiaowan who was on the left. When he pushed the wheelbarrow forward, for some reason, the hem of Lin Xiaowan\u2019s dress was caught in the wheel. Upon seeing this, he apologized profusely. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t see you.\u201d\nThe staff member looked very honest, and he was not very old.\n\u201cIt\u2019s all my fault. I\u2019m sorry. Don\u2019t move first. Let me see if I can pull your dress out.\u201d\nAs he spoke, he crouched down, blocking Lin Xiaowan\u2019s line of sight. He did not think too much about it and directly yanked Lin Xiaowan\u2019s dress that caught between the axis of the small wheels..\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

He did not dare to look at Lin Xiaowan and kept fiddling with the wheel and the dress.\nLin Xiaowan was unaware of the other party\u2019s nervousness, and she could not reach out to help him. She asked, \u201cHow is it? Can you pull it out?\u201d\nThe staff member glanced at her from the corners of his eyes. Seeing that she did not notice anything and that she looked more curious than anything else, he calmed down a little. He replied, \u201cIt\u2019s a little difficult to deal with. I\u2019m really sorry.\u201d\nAs he spoke, his eyes darted around. When his gaze landed at the end of the path, he saw Lu Yingxin. He sighed in relief immediately and relaxed completely. If Lu Yingxin did not show up, he would not have been able to do this. If it were not for the fact that Lu Yingxin offered him a lot of money, he would not have been willing to do this.\nLu Yingxin pretended as though she just happened to walk past this place. Her scenes had already ended during the day, and she was dressed in her own clothes at this moment. She ran over and asked, \u201cXiaowan, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan pointed at the hem of her dress and said, \u201cThe dress is a little long, and it got caught in the wheel.\u201d Then, she asked casually, \u201cYou don\u2019t have scenes to film?\u201d\nLu Yingxin took the initiative to come over and help out enthusiastically. She said, \u201cThat\u2019s right. My scenes ended during the day. Since I have nothing to do now, 1 can help you.\u201d\nThe staff member hurriedly stood up and said with an apologetic expression on his face, \u201cI\u2019m really sorry. I, I still have something to do\u2026 Can 1\u2026\u201d\nLu Yingxin quickly replied, \u201cOf course, you can go first. It\u2019s fine. We\u2019ll handle it.\u201d\n\nLin Xiaowan did not think it was a big deal so she nodded as well. \u201cYes, yes. If you have something to do then you can go ahead first.\u201d\nAfter the staff member left, Lu Yingxin took the initiative to put the jacket on her waist on the ground before she said, \u201cIt must be tiring for you to stand like that. If you don\u2019t mind, you can sit on my jacket.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan\u2019s back was indeed a little sore. She was forced to bend down and could not move freely because her hem was caught in the wheel. At most, she could only squat down, which would get tiring after a while as well. However, when she looked at the light blue jacket on the ground, she said, \u201cThis won\u2019t do. Don\u2019t put your jacket on the ground. It\u2019s dirty.\u201d\nLu Yingxin did not mind at all. She said, \u201cI\u2019ve already placed it on the ground anyway. It\u2019s fine. Just sit down.\u201d\nAs Lu Yingxin spoke, she used a little strength and pressed Lin Xiaowan\u2019s shoulders with both hands so Lin Xiaowan would sit.\nAfter sitting down, Lin Xiaowan felt much better so she no longer refused. She was already sitting on the jacket anyway. It would be a little pretentious if she kept refusing. She said, \u201cI\u2019ll bring the jacket with me later. 1\u201911 return it to you after I wash it.\u201d\nLu Yingxin was overjoyed. This was good. It would give her an excuse to visit Lin Xiaowan\u2019s house. Naturally, she hid her excitement and pretended to be indifferent as she said, \u201cIt\u2019s ok. Let\u2019s talk about this later. Let me see how to remove the hem from the wheel first. This is the film\u2019s costume, right? Are you acting as an extra again?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan replied, \u201cYes, but it was only for a short while. They haven\u2019t finished filming yet, but 1 snuck away.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan sounded a little embarrassed as she spoke and laughed a few times.\nAfter a long time, Lu Yingxin was still trying to remove the hem from the wheel with no success. She even removed the props in the wheelbarrow and laid it on its side, but the hem was still firmly caught in the wheel. She could not help but curse inwardly at the staff member.\n\u2018Why is it so tight? I told him to do it casually!\u2019\nFinally, Lu Yingxin sighed and said, \u201cIt\u2019s really not easy. My legs are numb from squatting. Let me stretch them for a while.\u201d\nLu Yingxin had been squatting the entire time she tried to remove the hem from the wheel, and her back and legs were a little sore. She looked at Lin Xiaowan, who was sitting on the ground, and could not help but curse at Lin Xiaowan even though she was the one who told Lin Xiaowan to sit. In her mind, she thought that Lin Xiaowan only cared about her own comfort and did not care if she was tired.\nMeanwhile, Lin Xiaowan saw that Lu Yingxin\u2019s hands, which were originally, had become dirty after touching the wheel and the axles. She felt very apologetic and quickly moved aside to make space for Lu Yingxin. She said, \u201cRest for a while. Sit here.\u201d\n\nUpon hearing these words, Lu Yingxin did not sit down. Instead, she squatted down again and said, \u201cNo need, no need. The faster we get this done, the earlier you can go home.\nWith this, Lin Xiaowan was even more grateful to Lu Yingxin. During the process, she tried to help Lu Yingxin several times, but she was stopped by Lu Yingxin.\nLu Yingxin was especially considerate of Lin Xiaowan. She said, \u201cIt\u2019s fine. My hands are already dirty anyway. 1\u201911 do it. Don\u2019t dirty your hands.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan\u2019s EQ.was not particularly high. Perhaps if it was another person, he or she would still reach out to help. However, Lin Xiaowan was the kind of person who would do as she was told without thinking too much about it. Since Lu Yingxin told her not to touch it, she would not touch it. However, when she thought about it later, she would feel bad and think of a way to treat the other party better. To put it bluntly, she was not very smart. In the workplace, she could even be called dumb. She was the kind who was easily led by the nose and would be gossiped about.\nThis was very in line with Lu Yingxin\u2019s plan to make Lin Xiaowan feel bad so she could get closer to Lin Xiaowan and enter Lin Xiaowan\u2019s life.\nAfter a long time, Lu Yingxin finally managed to loosen the hem a little. At this time, the dress was already very wrinkled. She said, \u201cOkay, it\u2019s getting looser\u2026\u201d However, Lu Yingxin still failed to remove it. In the end, she ran out of patience and sat down for a moment. She brought her phone out and asked, \u201cLet me rest for a moment. Do you want milk tea? 1\u201911 treat you to milk tea.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan was tempted. Her heart wavered, but she was still hesitant. \u201cYou\u2019ve already spent so much time helping me. 1 should treat you instead. However, my phone isn\u2019t with me.\u201d\nLu Yingxin was speechless when she heard this. In this age and time, there were still people who did not carry their phones with them everywhere they went. She did not think that Lin Xiaowan was lying. After all, a cup of milk tea did not cost much, and Lin Xiaowan did not lack this bit of money.\nFinally, Lu Yingxin took a seat next to Lin Xiaowan and said, \u201cIt\u2019s fine, it\u2019s fine. Don\u2019t worry about it. It\u2019s just a cup of milk tea. At most, you can treat me next time. What kind of milk tea do you want?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan had no preference so she said, \u201cI\u2019m fine with anything. I\u2019ll have whatever you\u2019re having. Thank you so much. 1\u201911 treat you to a meal next time.\u201d \u201cSure,\u201d Lu Yingxin said. This time, she did not stand on ceremony. In her opinion, the places where Lin Xiaowan would take her were all high-end places. She had a beautiful plan in her mind. Lin Xiaowan was an easy person to manipulate. When the time came, she would drop some hints. Perhaps at that time, she would be able to eat at an exclusive restaurant. For example, there was a courtyard house in the heart of the city that only served a table of old Shengjing cuisine every day. It was a place where Old Master Li could not enter even if he worked hard for 8oo years. Perhaps she could eat there.\nLin Xiaowan asked curiously, \u201cThey do delivery here?\u201d\n\u201cThey can even deliver food to the mountaintop. Why can\u2019t they deliver it here?\u201d\nAfter ordering the milk tea, Lu Yingxin finally relaxed. She sat next to Lin Xiaowan and said with a sigh, \u201cMy family is urging me to go on blind dates again. How annoying.\u201d\nThen, Lu Yingxin asked, \u201cXiaowan, how did you meet President Huo?\u201d\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

Other people would not be able to tell if she was talking about how lucky Dabao and Erbao were to be found by Lin Xiaowan or how lucky Lin Xiaowan was to have met Huo Zheng.\nLu Yingxin asked again, \u201cThen how many years have you been dating President Huo? Have you not considered marriage yet?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan did some mental calculations, excluding her previous life. She said, \u201cIt\u2019s been more than two years. As for getting married, there\u2019s no hurry.\u201d\nSince they had gotten engaged, Huo Zheng did not seem to be in a hurry to get married. Since Lin Xiaowan wanted to keep things small, apart from some good friends and business partners, not many people knew they were engaged. After all, there was no announcement to the media. As such, Lu Yingxin was also unaware of the engagement. In her mind, she was gloating, thinking that Huo Zheng had no intention of marrying Lin Xiaowan.\nOutwardly, Lu Yingxin frowned, seemingly worried for Lin Xiaowan. She asked, \u201cThe Huo family is a wealthy family after all. Are there many rules to marry into the family?\u201d\nLin Xiaowan shook her head. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not like that. Previously, my sister-in-law told me that the Huo family doesn\u2019t have any rules regarding that. They don\u2019t care about these things, especially in regards to relationships.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan did not mention the twists and turns last year regarding Song Zhiyi.\nLu Yingxin asked a few more questions about Lin Xiaowans relationship with Huo Zheng, and she felt even more confident the more she listened to Lin Xiaowan.\nAt this moment, Gu Yuwu appeared. She walked over, saying, \u201cAfter 1 was done with my work, I waited for you in my lounge for a while. 1 thought you got lost. As it turns out, you haven\u2019t even left the original place. Why are you sitting on the ground and chatting? Don\u2019t you feel cold?\u201d\n\nLin Xiaowan moved her butt aside a little and gestured as she said, \u201cLu Yingxin put her jacket on rhe ground.\u201d\nThen, she told Gu Yuwu about how her hem was caught in the wheel and that Lu Yingxin helped her for a very long time but still failed to remove it.\nGu Yuwu had no choice but to interact with Lu Yingxin due to work, but she could not help but dislike Lu Yingxin. After listening to Lin Xiaowan, she glanced at Lu Yingxin. Then, she squatted down and asked, \u201cIt\u2019s still not out? Let me take a look.\u201d\nGu Yuwu was very efficient. She tugged at it a few times. Seeing that it could not be removed, she immediately called someone in charge of the props to bring a pair of scissors over.\n\u201cScissors? Are you going to cur it off?\u201d Lin Xiaowan asked.\n\u201cYes. Otherwise, 1 don\u2019t know how long we\u2019ll have to stay here,\u201d Gu Yuwu said. She knew that Lin Xiaowan was worried about damaging the costume so she explained, \u201cIt s fine. We have many costumes like this. Moreover, this kind of small damage is within expectations.\u201d\nThe milk tea was sent to the entrance, and a staff member brought them in.\nT hinking that Lu Yingxin not only helped her for so long but even treated her to milk tea, Lin Xiaowan went to the lounge to get her bag before bringing her phone out to exchange contact information with Lu Yingxin.\nLu Yingxin noticed that the bag that Lin Xiaowan casually placed at the side was from a famous foreign brand. She had seen that bag featured in a magazine, and she knew the variation of Lin Xiaowan s bag was not even available in the country. Many people could not buy it even if they had the money.\nLu Yingxin was extremely envious. If she were in a relationship with Huo Zheng, she might even be able to buy a limited edition bag, let alone this bag. After all, Huo Zheng was from the Huo family. There were very few things he could nor buy.\nLin Xiaowan brought Lu Yingxin\u2019s jacket back. Two days later, after washing it, she took the initiative and called Lu Yingxin, asking when Lu Yingxin would be free or when Lu Yingxin would be at home so she could send the jacket over.\nSince Lu Yingxin did not live in Xilin Imperial Garden, she found an excuse and said she was not around. Then, she turned things around and asked when Lin Xiaowan would be at home, saying that she would come and pick the jacket up.\nLin Xiaowan felt bad when she heard this. \u201cNo, this isn\u2019t appropriate. I should send it to you instead. There\u2019s no need for you to come personally.\u201d\n\nLu Yingxin could not wait to go to Lin Xiaowan s house so how could she care about these things? She said, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing inappropriate about it. If you treat me as a friend, you don\u2019t have to be so polite.\u201d\nLu Yingxin calculated the time carefully and said, \u201cI still have something to do now. How about this? I ll come at 5 to get rhe jacket. If you\u2019re free, I\u2019ll bring my cat over to play with yours as well!\u201d\nIt was close to dinner time at 5 PM. In Lu Yingxin\u2019s opinion, if she went at this time, with Lin Xiaowan\u2019s personality, Lin Xiaowan would definitely ask her to stay for dinner. If she stayed for dinner, she would definitely be able to see HuO Zheng.\nAs expected, upon hearing these words, Lin Xiaowan said, \u201cIn that case, you should stay for dinner. Don\u2019t worry, I ll still treat you to a meal next time. This meal doesn\u2019t count!\u201d\n\u201cThen I won\u2019t stand on ceremony with you,\u201d Lu Yingxin said.\nLin Xiaowan asked a few questions about Lu Yingxin\u2019s food preferences before ending the call.\nSubsequently, Lin Xiaowan made her way to the kitchen from the living room. She made a simple note about Lu Yingxin\u2019s food preferences.\nUpon hearing the commotion, Aunt Wu came over. She asked curiously, \u201cDo we have guests coming for dinner?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s Lu Yingxin. Aunt Wu, do you still remember her? She visited me before. She\u2019s the one who brought a cat with her,\u201d Lin Xiaowan said.\nAunt Wu was slightly surprised. \u201cI remember. It\u2019s really hard to forget her. How did the two of you become good friends in such a short time?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re not good friends. She helped me a little when we were on set. Due to some circumstances, her jacket got dirty because of me. She was supposed to come over to pick up her jacket, but she wanted to bring her cat over to play as well. Since she\u2019s coming at 5,1 asked her to stay for dinner.\u201d\n\u201cI see,\u201d Aunt Wu said and did not say anything else.\nLin Xiaowan realized that the people around her, whether it was Gu Yuwu, Huo Zheng, or Aunt Wu, did not seem to like Lu Yingxin. She was a little curious as to the reason why. She could not help but ask, \u201cAunt Wu, you don\u2019t seem to like Lu Yingxin much. Why?\u201d\nAunt Wu found it difficult to answer this question. She frowned for a long time before she said, \u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t like her. In any case, I\u2019m old. Perhaps old people are more particular about affinity. For some reason, 1 just don\u2019t find her pleasing to the eye. I can\u2019t explain it.\u201d\nLin Xiaowan nodded. Although she was not prejudiced against Lu Yingxin like before and did not even mind having a meal with the latter, she still could not get close to Lu Yingxin. Perhaps their magnetic field repelled each other or their auras did not match..\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

She did not know what happened to the sickly orange cat from before. One day, when she returned, she found the cat lying on the ground and meowing. It did not move and did not want to eat. At that time, she did not think much of it. Unexpectedly, it died the next morning. She took the orange cat out and simply threw it into the garbage can. At that time, it was useless to use cats to get close to Lin Xiaowan so she was not in a hurry to buy another one. However, after receiving Lin Xiaowan's call today, she suddenly remembered she did not have a cat. In any case, it was not a problem since it was not difficult to buy a cat.  Lu Yingxin had her own assistant. Originally, she planned to ask her assistant to buy her a beautiful cat with a good personality. However, she remembered that Lin Xiaowan's employee had seen the dead orange cat before. With this, she could not just simply get another cat. In the end, she had no choice but to buy the cat herself. Fortunately, orange cats were very common. Moreover, the employee likely did not see the cat clearly. It was okay to buy one that looked similar.  \u2026  At 5.15 PM, Lu Yingxin rang the doorbell of Lin Xiaowan's house in Xilin Imperial Garden.  They could remotely open and close the gate and see the people at the entrance from inside the house. When Aunt Wu saw Lu Yingxin, she opened the gate for the latter. When she saw the cat in Lu Yingxin's arms, she took a few more glances.  Lu Yingxin noticed this and felt a little guilty. However, she did not show it on her face. Instead, she smiled and asked, \"Aunty, what's wrong? Don't worry. Mimi has been vaccinated. She's very healthy.\"  In fact, Lu Yingxin was simply talking. She had only gotten the cat an hour ago. She had not even given it a name until now nor did she know if it had been vaccinated. She had spontaneously come up with the name 'Mimi', and she did not know whether it was healthy or not.  \"Oh, it's nothing. I just thought it looked very small. It's still a kitten, right? Come in, come in,\" Aunt Wu said.  Lu Yingxin changed into the guest's slippers and asked, \"Where's Xiaowan?\"  \"Miss Lin is on the second floor. Follow me. I'll bring you there,\" Aunt Wu said, leading Lu Yingxin.  Lu Yingxin could not help but look around. She looked at the shoes on the shelf. There were many shoes in different styles, and she had seen Lin Xiaowan wear a few of them.  Lu Yingxin looked at the exquisite decorations in the house. She found them low-key but luxurious. She looked at the huge floor-to-ceiling windows, gorgeous crystal chandelier, and vast space. The living room was not very tidy. There were a few cute plush toys on the couch, and snacks could be seen on the coffee table. The living room was filled with vitality, showing signs of life. \n\n Almost every detail of the house was to Lu Yingxin's liking. She looked at everything greedily and covetously and could not help but fantasize about living here.  \u2026  Lin Xiaowan was combing Little Chestnut's fur at this moment. She had seen a video recently and wanted to collect Little Chetnut's fur and use it to make a plush toy. As such, she had been diligently combing Little Chestnut's fur and collecting its fur that had shedded.  When Lin Xiaowan saw Aunt Wu leading Lu Yingxin over, she quickly stood up. \"You're here.\"  When she saw the orange curled up in Lu Yingxin's arms, she was a little surprised. \"Wow, what a tiny kitten! It looks about three to four months old. Am I right? It's so cute!\"  Lu Yingxin bent down and placed the orange cat on the ground before she said, \"How is it cute? Yours is cuter. It's really beautiful and cute. I can tell at a glance that it's raised really well. You're amazing.\"  These words were sincere. Lu Yingxin indeed liked Little Chestnut. Its fur was long and slightly curly, and its eyes were big and round. It looked noble and beautiful. When it meowed, it looked and sounded very cute. It was not an exaggeration to say that it looked like a cat princess.  Lin Xiaowan squatted down and tried to pat the little orange cat. She asked, \"My cat's name is Little Chestnut. What's your cat's name?\"  Lu Yingxin had simply come up with the name earlier. She had to come up with an excuse for the name. She said, \"I'm not very good at naming so I simply named it Mimi.\"  \"It's still a good name. It sounds cute,\" Lin Xiaowan said.  After the little orange cat was placed on the ground, it stood there uneasily and did not dare to move. Its tail was tightly tucked between its legs, and upon closer inspection, one could even see it was trembling slightly. It was clearly very afraid of Lin Xiaowan.  When Lu Yingxin saw how disappointing the cat was behaving, she quickly explained, \"Mimi usually stays at home and rarely goes out so she's very timid.\"  Lin Xiaowan nodded in understanding. \"Yes, yes. Moreover, cats are afraid of unfamiliar environments. They behave like that when they're in an unfamiliar environment\u2026\"  At this time, Little Chestnut, who was lying comfortably on a pet hammock, jumped down after seeing an unfamiliar person and an unfamiliar cat in its territory. It stood in the distance and watched. \n\n Lin Xiaowan rose to her feet, intending to get some treats. She did not know how old Mimi was, so she asked, \"How old is Mimi? Can she eat treats now?\"  Lu Yingxin naturally had no idea when a cat could start eating treats. However, she answered, \"Yes, she can.\"  When Little Chestnut heard the word 'treats', it immediately ran to Lin Xiaowan and began to purr.  After getting the treats, Lin Xiaowan sat cross-legged on the ground. She called out to Lu Yingxin, \"Don't just stand there. The floor has been cleaned. I usually sit on the floor. If you're not used to it, you can sit on this small stool.\"  Lu Yingxin thought about it for a moment. In order to get closer to Lin Xiaowan, she decided to sit on the floor as well.  Little Chestnut kept nudging Lin Xiaowan's hand with its head.  Lin Xiaowan fed Little Chestnut a treat and laughed. \"You little glutton, we have to wait for your\u2026\"  Lin Xiaowan wanted to say 'little sister' seeing that Lu Yingxin's cat was called Mimi. However, just to be sure, she asked, \"Is Mimi a boy or a girl?\"  \"It's a girl,\" Lu Yingxin said, looking at Little Chestnut. She really liked Little Chestnut, but it did not care about her at all and kept circling Lin Xiaowan. It even ignored the little orange cat.  After a moment, Lu Yingxin asked, \"Can I touch Little Chestnut?\"  \"Give her a treat first so she can familiarize herself with you. She doesn't like strangers touching her. If she eats the treat, you can touch her,\" Lin Xiaowan said, \"By the way, Mimi is really obedient.\"  At this time, Mimi was already eating the treat that Lin Xiaowan fed it. It was not vigilant at all. When it smelled the treat, it could not wait to eat at all. It looked quite thin, but it could eat a lot.  In fact, Mimi was really hungry. Before it was bought, it had to compete for food with other cats. It was thin and small so it naturally could not compete with the others. Moreover, it was also beaten.  Moreover, since Lu Yingxin bought it until now, she did not even give it a sip of water, let alone food.\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

Perhaps Little Chestnut was with its mother for a period of time and was used to living outside. As long as there was someone it trusted and was familiar with, it would be very relaxed regardless of its environment. However, it did not get close to humans easily.  It was the same today. Although Lu Yingxin was almost lying on the ground coaxing Little Chestnut with treats, Little Chestnut only allowed Lu Yingxin to touch it twice before it ran away. However, Lu Yingxin was not only not angry, but she continued to try to get closer to it.  Seeing how much Lu Yingxin liked Little Chestnut, Lin Xiaowan thought that the former had to be a cat lover.  Little Chestnut, who had always been doted on, seemed a little unhappy that Lin Xiaowan was only playing with the little orange cat. It ran over and pushed the orange cat away before it rubbed itself against Lin Xiaowan as though it was begging for attention from Lin Xiaowan.  The little orange cat did not dare to resist and had no intention of fighting back. After it was pushed aside, it got up and let out a soft cry.  Lin Xiaowan felt that it was very cute and a little pitiful. She rubbed Little Chestnut's head and chided gently, \"What did you do?\"  \u2026  At 6 PM, Aunt Wu came up and told them that dinner was ready.  Lin Xiaowan was afraid that Little Chestnut and Mimi would fight if she left them alone. Although Little Chestnut was usually docile and obedient and Mimi looked timid, no one knew what would happen if they were left unattended.  In the end, Lin Xiaowan placed Mimi in a room that was used as an examination room. There were a few simple pieces of equipment inside. A vet would come over regularly to examine Little Chestnut. However, Little Chestnut was not very welcoming to the vet and would show a bitter expression whenever one came.  Lu Yingxin looked at the second floor that was filled with cat supplies and toys. There were also cute signs hanging on the glass doors of different rooms. There was a grooming room, an examination room, and there was even a wardrobe. Seeing all these things, she could not help but feel envious of a cat. She said, \"These are all for Little Chestnut? Her life is really good.\"  Lin Xiaowan only smiled and did not say anything else. Huo Zheng was the one who arranged all these things. He probably had never done something like that before so he simply added all kinds of things.  \u2026 \n\n When they went downstairs, Huo Zheng happened to walk out of the cloakroom on the first floor. He did not look as indifferent as he usually did. When he was at home, he was more relaxed and gentle; he did not look so difficult to get close to.  Lu Yingxin found it difficult to look away from Huo Zheng. However, she was afraid that Lin Xiaowan would discover her actions so she forced herself to look at Lin Xiaowan. Alas, her eyes would still drift to Huo Zheng from time to time. After a moment, she revealed a smile, which she had practiced many times in front of the mirror, and looked straight into Huo Zheng's dark eyes as she said, \"Hello, President Huo. We meet again.\"  Huo Zheng did not want to talk to Lu Yingxin. He only nodded at her coldly in response before he looked at Lin Xiaowan and asked, \"Why aren't you wearing your house slippers? It's not summer yet, 14:54  and the floor is very cold.\"  As he spoke, he went to the cabinet near the entrance and took out a pair of fluffy slippers. Then, he waved Lin Xiaowan over and helped her put on the slippers. In accordance with the principle of not lecturing his wife in front of others, he only pinched the tip of her nose slightly and gave her a warning look.  Lin Xiaowan smiled and did not take him seriously. She asked teasingly, \"So does this mean I can go barefoot in the summer?\"  \"No, you have to wear it all year round.\"  Lu Yingxin did not care that Huo Zheng treated her coldly. She still maintained a smile on her beautiful face as she walked to Lin Xiaowan's side.  Upon seeing Lu Yingxin, Lin Xiaowan recalled that she had yet to tell Huo Zheng about Lu Yingxin's visit. At the same time, she remembered Huo Zheng telling her not to get close to Lu Yingxin. As such, she quickly explained the purpose of Lu Yingxin's visit.  \"I brought her jacket back to wash two days ago. She came over to pick it up and brought her cat over to play. As such, I asked her to stay for dinner,\" Lin Xiaowan said in a low voice before asking, \"What's wrong? You don't mind, do you?\"  Huo Zheng had heard about Lu Yingxin's enthusiastic help a few days ago so he did not say anything.  \u2026  During dinner, Lu Yingxin deliberately sat with her back straight and ate slowly. She chewed a long time before she swallowed a small amount of food. In comparison to Lin Xiaowan who was picky with her food, she felt that she surpassed Lin Xiaowan in all aspects, be it her sitting posture, manner of eating, and everything else.  Huo Zheng did not even bother to glance at Lu Yingxin from the corners of his eyes; he did not spare her a glance at all.  As for Lin Xiaowan, she knew Huo Zheng would not be strict with her when outsiders were around so she was especially unrestrained. \n\n Seeing the various meat dishes on the table, Huo Zheng naturally understood Lin Xiaowan's thoughts. He could only helplessly indulge her, vowing to let her eat more vegetables the next time.  \u2026  After the meal, Lu Yingxin did not stay any longer and left very quickly.  Lin Xiaowan politely sent Lu Yingxin to the door with Huo Zheng by her side.  The sky was dark, and it was a little windy at this time. Worried that Mimi would catch a cold, Lin Xiaowan even gave Lu Yingxin a new pet carrier.  Lin Xiaowan stood at the door and asked, \"Are you staying in Xilin Imperial Garden tonight?\"  Lu Yingxin did not have a house here so how could she stay here? However, due to her vanity, she said, \"Yes, yes. Alright, I'm leaving now. Go in first!\"  Xilin Imperial Garden was very private. The houses were very far apart. As such, it was impossible for Lin Xiaowan to tell if Lu Yingxin really went back to her house in Xilin Imperial Garden or not. This was also one of the reasons Lu Yingxin felt at ease lying.  However, Lu Yingxin was unaware that Huo Zheng had investigated her and was aware of everything. He had long known that she did not live in Xilin Imperial Garden.  Nonetheless, Huo Zheng did not expose Lu Yingxin's clumsy lie. After Lu Yingxin walked away, he put his arm around Lin Xiaowan's shoulder and asked, \"She's already left. Why are you still looking? It's windy outside. Let's go in.\"  Not long after they entered the house, Aunt Wu came over and pulled Lin Xiaowan to the side, looking mysterious.  \"What's wrong, Aunt Wu?\" Lin Xiaowan asked, puzzled.  Aunt Wu looked like those female students who loved to gossip at this moment. She asked, \"Miss Lin, do you know how many cats Miss Lu has at home?\"  Lin Xiaowan did not know why Aunt Wu would ask this. She recalled her conversation with Lu Yingxin earlier. She remembered Lu Yingxin said it was her first time raising a cat and that she had no intention of raising another one.  \"I think she only has one cat. She said it's her first time raising a cat,\" Lin Xiaowan replied.  Aunt Wu's eyes widened in surprise. Then, she said, \"Miss Lin, don't blame me for thinking too much. However, I suspect the cat she brought over earlier isn't the same as the one she brought over previously.\"  \"Huh? How can it be?\" Lin Xiaowan said, confused.\nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

She said, \u201cIt\u2019s true! Although she only stood at the gate at that time, I noticed that one of the cat\u2019s paw pads was black. Although 1 can\u2019t remember which one it is, when I fed Little Chestnut earlier, I fed Mimi as well. At that time, 1 took a look. Not one of Mimi\u2019s paw pads was black at all. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s my imagination. I have a strong feeling that this cat is different from the one before!\u201d  Indeed, the orange cat from before was a little bigger than Mimi. It was also a little longer than Mimi.  Lu Yingxin also knew about the difference in the cats\u2019 sizes. However, she was confident that Aunt Wu did not see the orange cat clearly previously since she was holding it in her arms at that time. For this reason, she did not care about the difference in sizes, let alone the colors of their paw pads. Who knew Aunt Wu would be so observant?  Lin Xiaowan had never seen the previous cat before so she was a little skeptical. She asked, \u201cCould you have seen it wrongly?\u201d  Despite her question, Lin Xiaowan did not think Aunt Wu was lying. After all, compared to Lu Yingxin, Aunt Wu had been with her for a long time, and she trusted Aunt Wu. It was just that she found this matter strange.  \u201cI\u2019m old, but not that old. My brain and my eyes are working fine,\u201d Aunt Wu said.  Lin Xiaowan asked, puzzled, \u201cThen in your opinion, does she have two cats?\u201d Aunt Wu had spent some time thinking about this matter earlier. She said, \u201cI felt a little suspicious and was thinking about it when I fed the cats earlier. 1 remember the cat previously was very thin, and it didn\u2019t look very healthy\u2026\u201d \u201cPerhaps she changed the cat because the cat from before\u2026\u201d Aunt Wu speculated out loud. She paused briefly to check Lin Xiaowan\u2019s expression before she continued to say, \u201cBecause the cat before is already dead\u2026\u201d Meanwhile, Huo Zheng, who was watching the news, heard this and raised an eyebrow.  Lin Xiaowan\u2019s eyes widened as she said, \u201cHow can this be? 1 saw her playing with Little Chestnut in the afternoon. She seemed to really love cats. As you know, Little Chestnut doesn\u2019t like strangers. However, she was very patient and didn\u2019t seem angry at all.\u201d  Aunt Wu gently patted the back of Lin Xiaowan\u2019s hand and said, \u201cLook at her cat. It\u2019s so thin and weak. She should know that cats are afraid of unfamiliar environments. If she really loved the cat, why wasn\u2019t she worried about agitating her cat?\u201d \n\n Lin Xiaowan\u2019s impression of Lu Yingxin had improved greatly because of the latter\u2019s help when they were on set. However, after listening to Aunt Wu\u2019s logical analysis, she felt that Aunt Wu was right.  \u201cYou\u2019re right. Little Chestnut isn\u2019t afraid of unfamiliar environments as long as we\u2019re around so 1 overlooked this point,\u201d Lin Xiaowan said, \u201cYou\u2019re right. Mimi looks weak. When I touched her, she was trembling a lot. She was clearly frightened, but she didn\u2019t dare to move at all. 1 thought it was only afraid of strangers, but in hindsight, it\u2019s clearly more than that\u2026\u201d  The more Lin Xiaowan thought about it, the more shocked she was. Finally, she said, \u201cI\u2019ll ask her about it if I have the chance. Filming will wrap up next month. I\u2019ll ask Sister Yuwu about it. Perhaps I\u2019ll attend the closing ceremony of the filming.\u201d  \u201cYou have to be wary of others,\u201d Aunt Wu advised earnestly.  Lin Xiaowan scratched her head. She could not figure out why Lu Yingxin would say that it was her first time raising a cat or why she replaced the dead one with a new one and pretended that they were the same.  A week passed.  Zhu Yingyue had already bought the shop next door, and she began her plan to expand the business. While the shop was being renovated, she wanted to ask Lin Xiaowan for more ideas on what they could do.  Recently, Lin Xiaowan did not paint much. She only painted a few watercolor paintings when she was on set. When she received Zhu Yingyue\u2019s call, she thought that she might find inspiration by going over to have a look. Perhaps she could draw a few anthropomorphic construction tools.  When she left Xilin Imperial Garden, the security guard at the entrance recognized the car\u2019s license plate. He asked, \u201cIt\u2019s so bright out today. Are you going out to play, Miss Lin?\u201d  Lin Xiaowan did not find the question strange. She answered casually, \u201cNo, I\u2019m going to the shop to do something.\u201d  The shop next door was larger than Lin Xiaowan had imagined, and it also had two floors. The original fixtures had already been dismantled, and everything had been cleared.  According to Zhu Yingyue\u2019s plan, the ingredients and finished products would be displayed downstairs. When the time came, they would also display the patissiers\u2019 certificates. They would display the menu so customers could choose what they wanted to make. The prices would also be clearly listed. \n\n Lin Xiaowan thought that the place was very big.  The second floor was much more spacious than the first floor. There were different rooms of different sizes, and they were very well-equipped. The largest room in the innermost area would be used to host small events.  After Zhu Yingyue told Lin Xiaowan about her idea, she led Lin Xiaowan away and said, \u201cThese are my ideas. Xiaowan, let me know if you have any ideas as well.\u201d  Lin Xiaowan did not have any ideas. She shook her head and said, \u201cI think your ideas are very good, Sister. However, is our budget enough?\u201d  According to Zhu Yingyue\u2019s plan, the first floor would be mainly used as a display area. Moreover, they had spent a lot on the renovation. If they used the ingredients next door here for people to choose, the price definitely would not be cheap.  Zhu Yingyue did not seem worried about the budget at all. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a problem. The dessert shop is popular. We won\u2019t have a problem paying for this. As long as the environment and our service are good, we don\u2019t have to worry about not having customers. Moreover, we have many loyal fans of the dessert shop. There\u2019ll be no lack of customers. Don\u2019t worry. You just need to sit back and wait to receive money.\u201d  Zhu Yingyue was indeed a top finance student. She analyzed everything logically and systematically, including the customers.  The signboard for the dessert shop was very simple, but Zhu Yingyue planned to have more embellishments for the signboard of this shop.  The two women went out to look at the storefront to discuss the signboard. As soon as they stepped outside, Lin Xiaowan saw Lu Yingxin, who was looking at her phone. Lu Yingxin seemed to be waiting for someone at this moment.  Lin Xiaowan immediately thought about the \u2018cat swap\u2019 incident that Aunt Wu mentioned. She paused in her tracks, thinking if she should pretend like she did not see Lu Yingxin or if she should greet Lu Yingxin.  However, before Lin Xiaowan could make up her mind, Lu Yingxin had already seen Lin Xiaowan. She smiled and quickly walked toward Lin Xiaowan..\n6427efcab6463e50e8b1da9c\nIf you want to read more chapters, please visit AllNovelNext.Com to experience faster update speed  \nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

She was dressed in sportswear today, and her hair was pulled up into a bun; she looked energetic and youthful. She seemed to have learned a new makeup technique. The corners of her eyes that were originally raised made her look sharp, but now, she looked much gentler. Recently, she had considered going overseas to get plastic surgery. In her opinion, Lin Xiaowan was average in all aspects, but she was envious of Lin Xiaowan\u2019s bright and round eyes. She felt that if she had eyes like Lin Xiaowan, Huo Zheng would like her more.  Lin Xiaowan was naturally unaware of Lu Yingxin\u2019s thoughts. She put the matter of the cats aside and greeted the latter.  Lu Yingxin gestured at the bag in her hands and said to Lin Xiaowan, \u201cI queued up for a long time to buy these. 1 originally planned to share them with my friend, but my friend suddenly stood me up. Do you want to try them?\u201d  The bag was lined with an oil wrapper. One could easily smell the fragrance of its content, but there was no indication of what it was from the bag.  Lin Xiaowan asked, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d  \u201cThey\u2019re Five Fortune Flatbread. I bought them from an old shop on Huaihai Road. 1 bought the ones with shrimp and meat fillings. They\u2019re really delicious,\u201d Lu Yingxin said. Then, she took out a piece for Lin Xiaowan before she said, \u201cHere, try it. I can\u2019t finish two servings on my own so 1 want to share them with you. I waited in line for two hours for them.\u201d  Needless to say, Lu Yingxin did not make any plans with her friend at all. She heard from the security guard in Xilin Imperial Garden that Lin Xiaowan had gone to the dessert shop so she quickly came to wait for Lin Xiaowan. On the way here, she had been thinking of ways to get closer to Lin Xiaowan, and coincidentally, she passed by the flatbread shop. Also, she did not queue up for the flatbread and bought it from someone else at a high price. She sent her assistant to do it since she was too embarrassed to do it herself.  In Lu Yingxin\u2019s opinion, although she did not gain a lot of fans after participating in a variety show, she believed that she was a little famous. Moreover, her first movie was about to premiere. When the movie premiered, and if this matter was exposed, it would be difficult for her to explain herself, and it would bring a host of trouble to her. For this reason, she had asked her assistant to discreetly buy the flatbread from someone.  Lu Yingxin had a scale in her heart. She thought that this was only a small price to pay. When she became Mrs. Huo in the future, she could buy the entire shop if she wanted to, let alone the Five Fortune Flatbread.  With this thought in mind, Lu Yingxin\u2019s smile grew brighter when she looked at Lin Xiaowan. \n\n Lin Xiaowan could not resist Lu Yingxin\u2019s enthusiasm so she could only accept it. She said, \u201cThank you so much. I haven\u2019t even treated you to a meal yet, but you\u2019ve already treated me to a meal\u2026\u201d  Lu Yingxin laughed. \u201cThis is just a small matter. It\u2019s not a big deal.\u201d  Needless to say, only Lu Yingxin herself knew if this was a small matter or not.  Lin Xiaowan looked at the time and said, \u201cWell, there\u2019s no time like the present. 1\u201911 treat you to a meal today. Are you free tonight?\u201d  Lu Yingxin was very eager. She said, \u201cOf course. I\u2019m an idle person.\u201d  However, after that, Lu Yingxin pretended to say, \u201cBut don\u2019t force yourself. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re busy, right?\u201d  Lin Xiaowan said, \u201cNo, no, I\u2019m almost done.\u201d  Lin Xiaowan told Lu Yingxin to wait for her at the dessert shop for a while. She even personally brought the latter over and told an employee to put everything Lu Yingxin ordered on her tab.  When Lin Xiaowan came out, she saw that Zhu Yingyue was still waiting for her at the entrance of the new shop. She ran over and said apologetically, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Sister. I wanted to have dinner with you tonight, but it seems like we can only do it another time.\u201d  Zhu Yingyue did not mind at all. She said, \u201cIt\u2019s fine. We can eat together at any time. If you have something to do, go ahead.\u201d  Zhu Yingyue threw this matter to the back of her mind and pulled Lin Xiaowan over to look at the storefront. She said, \u201cThe two shops have completely different concepts so we can\u2019t possibly call this the dessert shop as well. Moreover, it\u2019ll be awkward if our customers enter the wrong shop\u2026 I\u2019m really not good at naming. Xiaowan, why don\u2019t you come up with a name?\u201d  Lin Xiaowan was also not talented in this regard. She stroked her chin as she said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we just call it the Creative Space? After all, we\u2019re providing baking classes to our customers. It involves a lot of creativity\u2026\u201d  \u201cThe Creative Space\u2026 Hmm, alright. Let\u2019s go with this name then,\u201d Zhu Yingyue said. \n\n Seeing how quickly Zhu Yingyue agreed, Lin Xiaowan felt nervous and hesitant. \u201cDon\u2019t you think this is too hasty? Shouldn\u2019t we come up with a few more names?\u201d  Zhu Yingyue said with a smile, \u201cYou can come up with more names if that\u2019s what you want. I have no objection to that\u2026\u201d  Upon hearing this, Lin Xiaowan said decisively, \u201cThere\u2019s no need for that. Let\u2019s just go with the Creative Space. It sounds good.\u201d  After that, Zhu Yingyue spoke about the patissiers. She had not sent Lin Xiaowan the list, and Lin Xiaowan had been going to the filming set recently. Since they met today, she decided to discuss the matter again.  \u201cI\u2019m not in a hurry. After all, the shop is still being renovated. We have time to look for good patissiers,\u201d Zhu Yingyue said.  \u201cIf you\u2019re not in a hurry, then I\u2019m not in a hurry. Anyway, just send me a message if you need anything. However, if you send me an e-mail, remember to call me. I don\u2019t usually check my e-mails,\u201d Lin Xiaowan said.  Zhu Yingyue made an \u2018okay\u2019 gesture as she said, \u201cAlright.\u201d  When Lin Xiaowan and Zhu Yingyue\u2019s discussion about the shop was almost over, Lin Xiaowan called Huo Zheng and informed him that she would not be going home for dinner.  When Huo Zheng received the call, he was about to get off work and leave. Upon hearing that Lin Xiaowan was not having dinner at home, his smile drooped a little as he said, \u201cYou\u2019re eating out with your friend? Remember to watch you eat, okay?\u201d  Then, Huo Zheng lowered his voice before he continued to say, \u201cIf 1 find out that you didn\u2019t listen to me, I\u2019ll punish you.\u201d  Lin Xiaowan\u2019s ears turned red. She knew what Huo Zheng meant by \u2018punish*. She decided to be magnanimous and not quarrel with the 30-year-old man. She coughed lightly and said, \u201cBy the way, I\u2019m having dinner with Lu Yingxin.\u201d Huo Zheng frowned as soon as he heard these words. He did not understand why Lin Xiaowan was with Lu Yingxin again. \u201cWhy are you with her again?\u201d  Lin Xiaowan told Huo Zheng about their coincidental encounter at the entrance of the dessert shop and even told him about the Five Fortune Flatbread. Then, she said, \u201cThe Five Fortune Flatbread is really delicious. I didn\u2019t know about it before..

Without waiting for Huo Zheng\u2019s response, she continued to say, \u201cPreviously, I told Lu Yingxin that I would treat her to a meal. I even mentioned it again when she visited our house. I felt bad so I invited her out tonight.\u201d  Huo Zheng asked worriedly, \u201cWhere are you going to eat?\u201d  Lin Xiaowan was not in a hurry to go to the dessert shop. She replied, \u201cWe haven\u2019t decided yet. Since I said I\u2019m going to treat her, it\u2019s more appropriate if she chooses the place.\u201d  Huo Zheng said, \u201cAlright, alright. Send me the address once you\u2019ve decided, okay? 1\u201911 pick you up when you\u2019re done.\u201d  Lin Xiaowan said, looking troubled, \u201cThe driver is with me. The driver can just send me back. There\u2019s no need for you to go to so much trouble.\u201d  The duo chatted for a while more. When Huo Zheng heard the sound of a car honking from Lin Xiaowan\u2019s side, he urge her to go and eat before ending the call.  As soon as the call ended, Huo Zheng called his assistant over with a dark expression on his face. He said, \u201cGo and investigate Lu Yingxin again. Be more thorough when you check her recent movements.\u201d  Ever since he heard Aunt Wu\u2019s speculations about the cats, Huo Zheng felt even more strongly that something was amiss. Moreover, there were too many coincidences with Lu Yingxin. Although Shengjing City was not big, it was not small either. How was it possible for Lu Yingxin to run into Lin Xiaowan so frequently?  \u201cBring me the results later,\u201d Huo Zheng said.  \u2018Huh?\u2019  Assistant Song\u2019s reaction was a little slow. He looked at the clock hanging on the wall.  \u2018Isn\u2019t he going home to have dinner with the Young Madam?\u2019  Huo Zheng glanced at Assistant Song expressionlessly, and Assistant Song straightened his back and quickly said, \u201cYes, I\u2019ll bring it over as soon as there\u2019s a result.\u201d  With that, Assistant Song quickly slipped away. \n\n \u2018Damn it! It\u2019s fine if you don\u2019t go home. But is there a need to scare me like that?!\u2019  In the dessert shop.  When Lu Yingxin saw Lin Xiaowan walk in, she quickly rose to her feet and asked, \u201cAre you done? I\u2019m a little hungry.\u201d  Lin Xiaowan looked at the empty table in front of Lu Yingxin and asked, \u201cOh, you didn\u2019t order anything earlier? By the way, what do you feel like eating? Don\u2019t be polite with me. Just tell me what you feel like eating\u2026\u201d  Lu Yingxin had been sitting there for a long time, looking through a list of restaurants in Shengjing. There were a few restaurants that she had begged Old Master Li to bring her to before this. In her opinion, the restaurant at the top of the list had to be the best and the most expensive. For example, the private restaurant that she wanted to go to did not have many introductions.  Upon hearing Lin Xiaowan\u2019s words, Lu Yingxin pretended to look troubled as she said, \u201cHmm, I don\u2019t have any preference. However, my husband made a reservation at Mriai Waki previously, but he had some work to do at the last minute so the reservation was canceled. Why don\u2019t we eat there?\u201d  Lin Xiaowan had never heard of the restaurant before. She said, \u201cLet\u2019s just go there if that\u2019s what you want. Do we have to make a reservation?\u201d  Old Master Li rarely went out in public with Lu Yingxin. The number of times they ate outside could be counted on one hand. She only heard of the restaurant, and she had casually made up a story about having a reservation there. As such, she was not certain if they had to make a reservation. However, based on how exclusive it was, she was sure that they would need to make a reservation. As such, she said confidently, \u201cYes.\u201d  Lin Xiaowan asked Lu Yingxin to spell the name of the restaurant before she looked up the restaurant\u2019s phone number. However, when she called to make reservations, an employee told her that they were no longer taking reservations. With that, she regretfully conveyed the result to Lu Yingxin.  \u201cThen let\u2019s go to another restaurant. It\u2019s not like we have to go to this restaurant,\u201d Lu Yingxin said with a smile on her face. However, inwardly, she thought that Lin Xiaowan truly lived a good life by relying on Huo Zheng. She knew that if Huo Zheng had personally called, there would be no need for them to make a reservation at all. Not only that, but if she were with Huo Zheng, she was sure he could bring her to restaurants where ordinary people could not even enter.  Lu Yingxin felt extremely indignant. She could not help but wonder again how Lin Xiaowan managed to capture Huo Zheng\u2019s heart, and why it was not her. In her opinion, she was not inferior to Lin Xiaowan at all. In fact, she felt she was prettier than Lin Xiaowan and that she was more suited to stand next to Huo Zheng.  Lin Xiaowan naturally did not know much about dining outside. She had not even heard of the restaurant that Lu Yingxin mentioned. However, she thought Lu Yingxin\u2019s standard should be relatively high. As such, she tried her best to recall the good restaurants that she had been to with Huo Zheng and Gu Yuwu. After thinking for a while, she still could not think of anything so she asked, \u201cIs there anywhere else you want to go?\u201d  Lu Yingxin naturally had a backup plan. However, she pretended to think hard before she asked tentatively, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we go to the Sea Cloud Pavilion?\u201d  Lin Xiaowan looked up the restaurant on her phone again. This was another restaurant that she had never heard of. She asked again, \u201cDo we need to make reservations?\u201d  \u201cThe restaurant is quite big. I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll have a table for us,\u201d Lu Yingxin said, \u201cLet\u2019s go and have a look first. The Sea Cloud Pavilion is quite near.\u201d  Before leaving, Lin Xiaowan gave Lu Yingxin a lot of desserts from the shop. She knew that Lu Yingxin was not a member so she gave her a membership card and even charged the card to the highest limit for Lu Yingxin, paying for it out of her own pocket.  The Sea Cloud Pavilion was big. As Lu Yingxin said, there was no problem for them to eat there without making a reservation. \n\n When they arrived, Lin Xiaowan asked for a private room, and after taking a seat, she sent Huo Zheng the restaurant\u2019s address.  Huo Zheng was still working at the office. When he saw the message, he quickly replied.  [Huo Zheng: Don\u2019t eat raw seafood. Your stomach is weak. You can only eat cooked seafood, understand?]  The Sea Cloud Pavilion was famous for its raw seafood, especially its raw lobster. Huo Zheng was worried that she would not listen to him again.  Fortunately, Lin Xiaowan had never been too enthusiastic about raw seafood. She quickly responded to his message.  [Lin Xiaowan: 1 know, I know-]  When the waiter brought the menu over, Lin Xiaowan did not take it. Instead, she gestured to Lu Yingxin to take it as she said, \u201cSince I\u2019m treating you, you should order. I don\u2019t know what you like to eat.\u201d  Lu Yingxin did not stand on ceremony with Lin Xiaowan. She looked at the menu for a moment before she asked the waiter, \u201cDo you have any recommendations?\u201d  The waiter skillfully recommended a few popular dishes. Among them were raw fish and raw lobster.  Lin Xiaowan had no interest in them, but seeing that Lu Yingxin was interested, she naturally did not object.  This was Lu Yingxin\u2019s first time eating out with Lin Xiaowan so she felt that she should not be too presumptuous. She ordered a Monte Carlo sea bass before she handed the menu to Lin Xiaowan and said, \u201cEven if you\u2019re treating me to a meal, you should order what you like as well.\u201d  Lin Xiaowan said with a laugh, \u201cI\u2019m more interested in desserts.\u201d  Upon hearing this, the waiter quickly said, \u201cWe have the winter gummy bear dessert in our restaurant that\u2019s popular with young people. Those who\u2019ve tried it all praised it. Would you like to try it?\u201d  Lin Xiaowan nodded decisively before she asked Lu Yingxin, \u201cDo you want to try it as well?\u201d  \u201cSure,\u201d Lu Yingxin replied. She naturally would not refuse..\n6427efcab6463e50e8b1da9c\nIf you want to read more chapters, please visit AllNovelNext.Com to experience faster update speed  \nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

I want to try it. Are you okay with it?\u201d  Lu Yingxin, of course, had no objections. She nodded every time Lin Xiaowan asked for her opinion.  Lin Xiaowan flipped through two more pages before she asked, \u201cI want soup. Do you have any preference?\u201d  \u201cI\u2019m fine with anything,\u201d Lu Yingxin said.  Lin Xiaowan was a classic example of someone with big eyes and a small stomach. She wanted to eat everything she saw. As such, when she went out, she usually let others do the ordering. She was only responsible for eating. Since she was ordering today, it was not surprising that she could not make up her mind.  \u201cSeahorse pigeon soup? How interesting. I didn\u2019t know that seahorses are edible. Let\u2019s try it,\u201d Lin Xiaowan said.  After placing the order, the waiter served them fruits before the meal started. There were strawberries, blueberries, and peeled lychees on the exquisite plate.  As they chatted, Lin Xiaowan kept thinking about the matter that Aunt Wu mentioned. In the end, she could not help but ask, \u201cBy the way, how\u2019s your little orange kitten? Has it grown in size?\u201d  At this moment, Lu Yingxin was showing off the fact that she was eating in Sea Cloud Pavilion to her friends in a group chat. When she heard Lin Xiaowan\u2019s question, her hands that were typing paused for a moment. Then, with a smile on her face, she lied with a straight face, saying, \u201cI\u2019ve been a little busy recently, and I\u2019m often not at home. 1 was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to care for it so my friend\u2019s helping me to temporarily care for it.\u201d  The orange cat stayed awake until late in the night and kept meowing. Lin Xiaowan\u2019s house was not big. Even if she locked the cat up in the furthest room, she could still vaguely hear the cat meowing at night. The sound was sharp, making her annoyed. She was also worried that the neighbors would complain. As such, she simply brought the kitten outside and left it there. In her opinion, the cat was useless to her. If she needed it, she could simply get another one.  \u201cOh,\u201d Lin Xiaowan said. She did not know what else to ask so she only said, \u201cBring Mimi to play the next time you\u2019re free. Since both of us are staying in Xilin Imperial Garden, it\u2019s not too troublesome. Moreover, cats need to socialize as well.\u201d  Lu Yingxin naturally could not easily agree to this. She said, \u201cMy friend doesn\u2019t live in Xilin Imperial Garden so it\u2019s a little inconvenient\u2026\u201d  \u201cOh, okay\u2026\u201d \n\n Lin Xiaowan was not very good at speaking, to begin with. She could not directly ask Lu Yingxin if the cat Lu Yingxin brought over the first time was the same one she brought the second time. She also could not ask if Lu Yingxing\u2019s first cat died. However, she was also not good at talking in a roundabout manner.  Fortunately, the meal went smoothly. During the meal, Lu Yingxin would take the initiative to find topics to talk about. Logically speaking, the two got along rather harmoniously, but for some reason, Lin Xiaowan felt a little uneasy.  When the meal was finally over, Lin Xiaowan felt relieved. She naturally did not dare to show it on her face. She was not confrontational after all and was worried that Lu Yingxin would notice. It was uncomfortable for her to be around Lu Yingxin alone.  When the waiter appeared to lead them out, Lin Xiaowan relaxed greatly now that she was no longer alone with Lu Yingxin.  When the driver opened the car door for Lin Xiaowan, she politely said to Lu Yingxin, \u201cGet in the car. We\u2019re both going to Xilin Imperial Garden anyway.\u201d  Lu Yingxin did not live in Xilin Imperial Garden. How could she go back with Lin Xiaowan? She could not possibly go to Old Master Li\u2019s house. If she went to his house without any notice, he definitely would not let her off easily.  Lu Yingxin\u2019s lying skills were so good that she did not even need to think about it. She said with a straight face, \u201cYou go ahead. I still have something to do. 1 plan to visit Mimi at my friend\u2019s house.\u201d  Lin Xiaowan naturally no longer said anything upon hearing these words. After bidding farewell, she left.  Lu Yingxin waited until Lin Xiaowan\u2019s car was out of sight before she hailed a cab.  When Lin Xiaowan returned home, she realized that it was already quite late, but the housekeeper was still cleaning the house. When she heard the heart-wrenching yowling noises on the second floor, she quickly ran upstairs, shocked.  When Little Chestnut saw its mother, it no longer yowled. Instead, it meowed cutely, sounding a little aggrieved.  Little Chestnut\u2019s toys and belongings had been cleared away, and someone was spraying something everywhere at this moment. There was the smell of wormwood and a strange smell that permeated the second floor.  Little Chestnut was yowling earlier because it was forced to take a shower by the vet and Aunt Wu.  \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Lin Xiaowan asked, stunned.  \u2018The new year has passed, but we\u2019re doing spring cleaning now?\u2019  Huo Zheng was in another room, putting away Little Chestnut\u2019s toys and daily necessities. When he heard Lin Xiaowan\u2019s voice, he walked out. He smelled like wormwood as well. \n\n Lin Xiaowan scrunched up her face when she smelled it.  Huo Zheng\u2019s expression was quite unsightly at this moment. He came over and held her hand as he said, \u201cLet\u2019s go upstairs first.\u201d  As soon as they went upstairs, Huo Zheng pushed her to the bathroom to shower.  Lin Xiaowan grabbed him and asked in confusion, \u201cWait, wait. What\u2019s wrong? What happened?\u201d  Huo Zheng had been suppressing his anger ever since he came home. When he saw the confused expression on Lin Xiaowan\u2019s face, he was even more disgusted with Lu Yingxin. It was truly difficult for him to control his emotions so his voice was a little dark as he said, \u201cThere\u2019s a flea infestation. Aunt Wu saw fleas on Little Chestnut in the afternoon and arranged for people to clean them up.\u201d  Lin Xiaowan was shocked. \u201cFleas? How\u2019s that possible? Ever since we moved here, Little Chestnut hasn\u2019t been anywhere else. Not only do we frequently spray her with flea repellent, but she also hasn\u2019t gone out at all. How can there be a flea infestation?\u201d  Huo Zheng looked at Lin Xiaowan silently for a long time. After a while, he sighed helplessly and asked, \u201cSo what do you think is the reason?\u201d  Lin Xiaowan thought about it for a moment. The only thing that was out of the ordinary was that Little Chestnut had come in contact with Lu Yingxin and Mimi. She asked in disbelief, \u201cIt\u2019s from the kitten that Lu Yingxin brought over?\u201d  \u201cThere\u2019s no other possibility,\u201d Huo Zheng said confidently, determining the source of the flea infestation.  Lin Xiaowan was a little scared. \u201cI, I\u2019ve been playing with Little Chestnut frequently! Don\u2019t tell me I have fleas as well? You, do you have fleas?\u201d  Seeing the pitiful and aggrieved expression on her face, Huo Zheng quickly hugged her. However, just as he was about to kiss her, she pushed him away.  \u201cWhat are you doing? If there are fleas, won\u2019t it be contagious?\u201d  Huo Zheng said, amused, \u201cWe\u2019re fine. It\u2019ll be obvious if you have fleas. Does your scalp feel itchy recently?\u201d  \u201cNo\u2026 But what if I feel itchy after showering?\u201d Lin Xiaowan asked pitifully.  Huo Zheng sighed. \u201cForget it. Qingqing, go and shower first.\u201d  Huo Zheng threw away the clothes she wore immediately. He also went to the walk-in wardrobe on the fourth floor and brought a set of new clothes over for Lin Xiaowan..\n6427efcab6463e50e8b1da9c\nIf you want to read more chapters, please visit AllNovelNext.Com to experience faster update speed  \nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

It had also been treated with flea medicine.  There was still a strong smell of disinfectant mixed with wormwood on the second floor, and the smell was a little pungent.  Little Chestnut had to move temporarily. All its daily necessities had been moved to an empty room on the first floor. It was originally a guest room, but now it had turned into Little Chestnut\u2019s territory.  Lin Xiaowan asked nervously, \u201cIs the infestation very bad?\u201d  Aunt Wu was extremely dissatisfied with Lu Yingxin now. As soon as she sent the vet away, she looked for Lu Yingxin to complain. \u201cIt\u2019s not that bad. The vet said that it was good that we discovered it early. Otherwise, we might even have to shave our heads if we were infected. Miss Lin, tell me. Little Chestnut has always been very clean. How could there be fleas? It must be that lady who brought her cat over previously. There must be a problem with her.\u201d  Aunt Wu liked Little Chestnut a lot and would play it from time to time. Sometimes it was as though she treated Little Chestnut like her granddaughter. She was usually gentle and moderate. It was rare for her to complain and be impatient like she was now.  Aunt Wu knew Lin Xiaowan had dinner with Lu Yingxin earlier so she asked, \u201cMiss Lin, you had dinner with her earlier, right? Did you ask her about the cat?\u201d  From the moment Lin Xiaowan found out about the fleas, she had already suspected Lu Yingxin. Previously, she did not think too much about it. However, now that she thought about it carefully, she felt that her distrust toward Lu Yingxin had grown significantly, and she felt that something was very wrong.  Lin Xiaowan replied, \u201cI did ask her, but I didn\u2019t get any useful information.\u201d  Then, she added, \u201cHer answers were vague. Initially, I invited her to bring her cat over again. At that time, we can observe her and her cat. However, thinking about it now, fortunately, she didn\u2019t agree.\u201d  Aunt Wu was even more anxious than Lin Xiaowan. She said, \u201d1 hope she doesn\u2019t come again. The first time, she brought fleas with her. Who knows what she\u2019ll bring next? We have to disinfect the house properly. After all, fleas multiply quickly. I don\u2019t think we should keep Little Chestnut\u2019s things.\u201d  Lin Xiaowan said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, don\u2019t worry. She refused the invitation. She said that she was too busy to take care of the cat so she sent it to her friend\u2019s house temporarily. However, I have a feeling that she no longer intends to raise it.\u201d \n\n Aunt Wu rolled her eyes. Her dislike for Lu Yingxin was obvious. She said, \u201cIt\u2019s good if she doesn\u2019t raise the cat. It\u2019s so skinny and pitiful, and it even has fleas. She doesn\u2019t know how to care for it at all.\u201d  Lin Xiaowan went to the guest room to look at Little Chestnut. Perhaps it was suddenly caught and given a bath at night, it meowed pitifully, looking aggrieved, when it saw its mother. It rubbed against her leg as though it was asking to be comforted.  Lin Xiaowan picked Little Chestnut up and hugged it before she gave it a treat and said, \u201cLittle Chestnut, do you want a treat?\u201d  \u201cLittle Chestnut is still the best,\u201d Aunt Wu said.  At this time, Huo Zheng walked over and stroked Little Chestnut. However, Little Chestnut slapped his hand away with its paw before it pointed its butt at him, determined to ignore him.  \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Lin Xiaowan asked in confusion.  Usually, Huo Zheng did not play with Little Chestnut much, and he also did not feed it treats. Lin Xiaowan had always wondered how Huo Zheng could remain so stoic when faced with such a cute cat. Perhaps that was why Little Chestnut was not very close to Huo Zheng. In any case, Little Chestnut usually ignored him, but it would still allow him to pet it. This is the first time that it refused Huo Zheng.  Aunt Wu chuckled when she heard Lin Xiaowan\u2019s question. She said, \u201cWasn\u2019t she forced to take a bath earlier? It was Mr. Huo who caught her. She must be holding a grudge against him.\u201d  Lin Xiaowan laughed.  When Little Chestnut was young, it did not resist bathing. However, ever since its fur had grown, it became resistant to bathing. Perhaps it was because its body would become heavy when it was wet. In any case, it did not matter since cats did not need to shower as frequently as dogs did.  Lin Xiaowan handed Huo Zheng a treat and said, \u201cHere you go. You can bribe Little Chestnut.\u201d  Huo Zheng silently extended his hand to Little Chestnut. Although it was dissatisfied with Huo Zheng, when it saw the treat, it did not stand on ceremony and began eating. It even meowed when it ate.  Lin Xiaowan laughed. \u201cI wonder what she\u2019s saying.\u201d  Huo Zheng was both helpless and amused. \u201cPerhaps she\u2019s scolding me.\u201d  When they went to bed, Lin Xiaowan voiced her suspicion to Huo Zheng. She asked, \u201cDo you think it\u2019s possible that Lu Yingxin doesn\u2019t live in Xilin Imperial Garden at all?\u201d \n\n However, after she said that, she doubted herself again. She said, \u201cHowever, that doesn\u2019t make sense either. Otherwise, how could she come in and out so easily if she doesn\u2019t live here? The security here is quite strict after all.\u201d  In addition to access cards, there was a facial recognition system in place for owners. When visitors came, their information would be recorded, and the security guard would also call the owner they were visiting before they were let in. Otherwise, they would not be able to enter at all.  \u201cOh, right. Perhaps her husband lives here?\u201d Lin Xiaowan said when she recalled the man she had seen with Lu Yingxin the first time they met.  Huo Zheng rubbed Lin Xiaowan\u2019s head. More than once, he felt that Lin Xiaowan was really silly and cute. He said, \u201cShe doesn\u2019t live here. I felt that something was wrong before so I\u2026\u201d  Huo Zheng hesitated for a moment before he said, \u201cI asked around about her.\u201d \u201cHuh? Then why did she say that she\u2019s living in Xilin Imperial Garden? No wonder. The last time it rained, she said she was not going home when we wanted to send her home. It was the same tonight. When I said I\u2019d send her home, she said she had something to do.\u201d  Lin Xiaowan could not figure out why Lu Yingxin lied. It was too tiring to lie, after all. One would have to come up with more lies just to maintain the first lie. With that, one would be lying all the time.  With this thought in mind, Lin Xiaowan began to feel like this was not the only thing that Lu Yingxin lied about. For example, the matter regarding the cat. If it was as Aunt Wu said, if Mimi was not the first cat Lu Yingxin brought to the house, what happened to the first cat?  Lin Xiaowan tried to be optimistic, thinking that perhaps Lu Yingxin had given the first cat to a friend.  \u201cIf I had known, I would have insisted on sending her back. At least, 1 would\u2019ve known where she lived!\u201d  Huo Zheng laughed. \u201cWhat are you going to do even if you know where she lives?\u201d  Lin Xiaowan froze.  \u2018Indeed. What can 1 do?\u2019  After a moment, Lin Xiaowan clenched her hands and said, \u201cIf I see her again, I\u2019m going to ask her directly about the cat!\u201d  Although she could call Lu Yingxin, she preferred to communicate directly.  Perhaps it was the law of the universe, but when Lin Xiaowan wanted to meet Lu Yingxin, she could not meet Lu Yingxin at all. Until the end of May, she did not see Lu Yingxin again. Lu Yingxin did call her once, but she did not know what Lu Yingxin wanted because she did not answer the call..\n6427efcab6463e50e8b1da9c\nIf you want to read more chapters, please visit AllNovelNext.Com to experience faster update speed  \nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

Coincidentally, Gu Yuwu\u2019s filming had ended, and there was a party. Since Lin Xiaowan had nothing to do, she decided to attend the party with Gu Yuwu.  At the party to commemorate the completion of filming, Lin Xiaowan met Lu Yingxin.  The party was very lively. When Lu Yingxin saw Lin Xiaowan, she came over to greet Lin Xiaowan.  Lin Xiaowan smiled stiffly. She did not want to make things awkward in such a public setting, but she still could not help but ask, pretending to be casual, \u201cYou\u2019ve been so busy. How\u2019s Mimi doing?\u201d  How could Lu Yingxin know what happened to the cat she had abandoned? However, she was not flustered at all and lied with a straight face. She said, \u201cRemember 1 told you my friend was helping me to look after it? My friend likes Mimi a lot. Considering how busy 1 am most of the time, 1 decided to let my friend raise Mimi.\u201d  Lin Xiaowan asked skeptically, \u201cDo you really like cats?\u201d  In Lin Xiaowan\u2019s opinion, if Lu Yingxin really liked cats, she would not have given it away so easily. Moreover, it did not seem like she missed the cat at all. In fact, she looked very nonchalant about it.  Lu Yingxin\u2019s expression stiffened. She did not expect Lin Xiaowan to say such a thing. However, she quickly recovered and said, \u201cOf course. Why would you ask such a question?\u201d  There were many people at the party. Seeing that Lu Yingxin was so insistent, Lin Xiaowan no longer said anything about the cat. However, she recalled another matter and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go back together after the party. After all, we\u2019re staying in the same place. It\u2019s much more convenient for us to go back together.\u201d  Lu Yingxin smiled and said shyly, \u201cI\u2019ll have to refuse. My boyfriend is picking me up later.\u201d  For once, Lu Yingxin was not completely lying. She had an appointment with Old Master Li later so his driver would be picking her up later.  Nonetheless, Lin Xiaowan no longer believed Lu Yingxin\u2019s words. She nodded and said skeptically, \u201cI see.\u201d  Soon after Lu Yingxin excused herself, Gu Yuwu, who had left to speak to a young actress, returned. As she looked at Lu Yingxin\u2019s graceful back, she said unhappily, \u201cWhy do you always talk to her? That person has evil intentions. It\u2019s better to stay away from her.\u201d \n\n Thinking about how long Gu Yuwu had been in the entertainment industry, Lin Xiaowan asked, \u201cIs Lu Yingxin married? She looks quite young.\u201d  \u201cMarried? Who did she marry?\u201d Gu Yuwu asked, confused.  Lin Xiaowan replied, \u201cShe just said that her husband will pick her up later.\u201d  \u201cHusband? I\u2019m afraid he\u2019s just her\u2026 lover. She\u2019s a rookie. She just participated in a variety show, but she\u2019s not very popular and has no acting experience. Why do you think she\u2019s able to act in a famous director\u2019s movie? Isn\u2019t it because someone opened the back door for her?\u201d Gu Yuwu said. She did not shy away from speaking about this matter, but she still chose her words carefully.  \u201cThe first time I met her, she was holding a man\u2019s hands. Later on, she mentioned that he was her husband. So was she lying?\u201d Lin Xiaowan asked.  \u201cAnyway, don\u2019t trust her. I didn\u2019t like the moment 1 met her. For some reason, I just don\u2019t like her,\u201d Gu Yuwu said.  After the party ended, Gu Yuwu sent a good friend of hers from the entertainment industry to the door while Lin Xiaowan waited for the driver on the other side. At this time, Lu Yingxin approached her and greeted her again. Since no one was around, Lin Xiaowan could not avoid Lu Yingxin and could only respond to Lu Yingxin.  After a brief moment, Lin Xiaowan deliberately asked, \u201cWhen did you get married? I didn\u2019t expect you to marry so young\u2026\u201d  Lu Yingxin ran her fingers through her hair and thought about it for two seconds. In the end, she did not have the courage to further lie about this matter so she could only say, \u201cAh? I\u2019m not married yet.\u201d  Lu Yingxin tried to save the situation and continued to say, \u201cThe term \u2018husband\u2019 can be used even if you\u2019re not married. It\u2019s more like a term of endearment.\u201d  Then, Lu Yingxin asked curiously, \u201cThen how do you usually address President Huo?\u201d  Lin Xiaowan thought about it and suddenly realized that she did not have any terms of endearment for Huo Zheng. She said, \u201cI usually call him by his name.\u201d  Lin Xiaowan did not say that when she needed something, she would call him \u2018Brother\u2019. When she did not need anything, she would call him \u2018Huo Zheng\u2019.  Upon hearing this, Lu Yingxin\u2019s imagination ran wild again. In her opinion, Huo Zheng and Lin Xiaowan\u2019s relationship must not be very good since Lin Xiaowan did not even have a term of endearment for Huo Zheng. It seemed to her that Huo Zheng did not like Lin Xiaowan very much as well.  Lu Yingxin\u2019s mind continued to wander. She thought about how great it would be if Lin Xiaowan was not around. Without Lin Xiaowan, she could be Mrs. Huo. She would be able to spend endlessly and do whatever she wanted.  Lu Yingxin naturally did not like her current situation. In order to have better opportunities and resources, she had to serve a middle-aged man with a big belly. Not only that, but Old Master Li did not respect her at all and had strange interests. She was disgusted when she thought about him. At the same time, she thought to herself resentfully, \u2018Why is Lin Xiaowan so lucky?\u2019 \n\n At this time, a car honked twice as it turned around a corner.  Lu Yingxin\u2019s hand suddenly felt restless. She wondered if Lin Xiaowan would die if she pushed Lin Xiaowan out at this moment. Without Lin Xiaowan, she would be able to marry Huo Zheng and live a good life.  At this time, Lin Xiaowan\u2019s head was lowered. She was sending Huo Zheng a message. When she sensed a burning gaze, she looked up curiously.  Seeing this, the corners of Lu Yingxin\u2019s lips curled up into a friendly smile.  On the contrary, Lin Xiaowan smiled stiffly in response, feeling awkward.  When the driver arrived, Lin Xiaowan inexplicably gained some courage. Before entering the car, she suddenly looked at Lu Yingxin and asked, \u201cMimi isn\u2019t the same cat that you brought over the first time to my house, right?\u201d  Upon hearing this, Lu Yingxin\u2019s heart tightened, and her mind began to race. She said, \u201cWhat do you mean, Xiaowan? The first time 1 came to your house was when 1 brought Mimi, right?\u201d  Lu Yingxin\u2019s evasive reply made Lin Xiaowan even more suspicious. Indeed, the first time Lu Yingxin actually visited and entered the house was with Mimi. However, Aunt Wu had told her that Lu Yingxin had tried to visit prior to that. Clearly, Lu Yingxin was feigning ignorance. With Lu Yingxin\u2019s reply, she had almost no doubt now that Aunt Wu\u2019s suspicion was right. Lu Yingxin must have swapped her cats.  When the driver came over to open the door for Lin Xiaowan, she said to the driver gently, \u201cWait a minute. 1 still have a few things to say.\u201d  Lin Xiaowan looked at Lu Yingxin and saw the latter holding her phone nervously. It was obvious that the latter was lying. She said, a little angry, \u201cDon\u2019t try to play games with me. Didn\u2019t you try to visit once with a cat? 1 was busy at that time so we didn\u2019t meet in the end. However, my employee saw you and the cat. It\u2019s not the same cat as the one you brought over that time.\u201d  Lu Yingxin did not expect Aunt Wu to be so observant. However, she still said stubbornly, \u201cYour employee? How does she know if it\u2019s the same or not? What if she saw wrongly?\u201d  Lin Xiaowan grew angrier when she heard Lu Yingxin denying it. She said, \u201cIt\u2019s not just that. You don\u2019t even live in Xilin Imperial Garden, do you? In any case, I don\u2019t want to talk to you anymore. You know very well if it\u2019s the same cat or not.\u201d  Lin Xiaowan recalled Aunt Wu\u2019s words. She thought that Lu Yingxin would no longer want to speak to her after this. As such, she said without reservations, \u201cThe first cat was extremely frail. Who knew if you changed it because something happened to it? Did you abandon it or something?\u201d  The more Lin Xiaowan spoke, the more agitated she became. She said, \u201cMoreover, the cat you brought over had fleas. It even infected Little Chestnut. If you\u2019re a cat lover, how could the cat you raised have fleas? Fortunately, you gave the cat to your friend. Otherwise, 1 don\u2019t know how miserable it would be with you.\u201d  After saying that, Lin Xiaowan got into the car, leaving Lu Yingxin in a daze..\n6427efcab6463e50e8b1da9c\nIf you want to read more chapters, please visit AllNovelNext.Com to experience faster update speed  \nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

She only returned to her senses when her phone rang, and Old Master Li asked where she was in an unhappy tone.  When Old Master Li saw Lu Yingxin, his expression was very dark, and he slapped her. It caused her to almost lose balance.  Lu Yingxin was stunned. Her ears rang as she looked at him in shock.  Old Master Li had never been so angry with Lu Yingxin before. In fact, he did not look too bad. He was just like an ordinary middle-aged man. However, due to his anger at this moment, he looked a little scary.  He bellowed, \u201cWhat did you do behind my back? The company has gone through so many difficulties before finally obtaining a chance to discuss investment with Huo Corporation. However, before anything could come to fruition, the Huo Corporation suddenly didn\u2019t want to talk to us! Now, the company is going bankrupt! Do you understand? The company is going bankrupt!\u201d  Lu Yingxin was at a loss and confused. Her eyes were brimming with tears, and she looked pitiful as she said, \u201cI didn\u2019t do anything. It has nothing to do with me.\u201d  Old Master Li grew even angrier. \u201cYou didn\u2019t do anything? The employee from the Huo Corporation said that my lover was very capable. Isn\u2019t it obvious that you\u2019d done something? I told you long ago that Huo Zheng isn\u2019t someone you can afford to provoke. Why didn\u2019t you listen?\u201d  Lu Yingxin had tried to get close to Lin Xiaowan without Old Master Li\u2019s knowledge. After all, she knew he did not have a good temper. If he had known, she knew the result would be bad for her. She naturally did not dare to tell the truth and said half-truthfully with tears streaming down her face, \u201cI-I only met with that Lin Xiaowan a few times\u2026 1, 1 really didn\u2019t do anything\u2026\u201d  Old Master Li was furious. His company had been counting on this project to make a comeback. However, now his company was going under. Once it was liquidated, he would really have nothing left.  He had not been with Lu Yingxin for long. Initially, he thought that she was self-aware and well-behaved. However, after getting to know her, he knew that he had misjudged her and that she had a lot of thoughts in her mind. Nonetheless, he turned a blind eye to it, thinking that she would at least know her limits. Who knew she would be so reckless?  Old Master Li picked up a soft leather whip at the side and brought it down hard on Lu Yingxin. He had a special hobby, to begin with. As such, there were many \u2018torture devices\u2019 such as this in his house. \n\n Lu Yingxin could only beg for mercy. \u201cPlease! 1 really didn\u2019t do anything! Stop hitting me, stop hitting me! \u201d  Lu Yingxin instinctively dodged, but this only made Old Master Li angrier.  \u201cYou sl*t! How dare you dodge! You\u2019re still denying it? Do you think Huo Zheng and his wife are stupid?\u201d  Lu Yingxin\u2019s hatred for Lin Xiaowan reached unprecedented heights at this moment. Previously, she was only jealous that Lin Xiaowan was with a man like Huo Zheng. However, now she blamed Lin Xiaowan for all her misfortunes.  Lu Yingxin cried as she said, \u201cIt\u2019s Lin Xiaowan! It s all her fault! She must have said something to Huo Zheng! It\u2019s all her fault!\u201d  Although Old Master Li had met Lin Xiaowan before, he did not know her name. When he heard Lu Yingxin\u2019s words, he hit even harder as he said, \u201cI don\u2019t care about her. All I know is that it\u2019s because of you that my f*eking project failed!\u201d  As Lu Yingxin was hit, she thought about Lin Xiaowan\u2019s sweet smile and Lin Xiaowan\u2019s good life, making her mind grow even more and more twisted.  By the time Old Master Li vented his anger, it was already late at night. He did not even spare a glance at Lu Yingxin. After all, he had no feelings for her, to begin with. He naturally did not pity her. He only scoffed at her coldly before he left to take a shower and change his clothes.  When he came out, he stood by the bed and looked down at Lu Yingxin as he said, \u201cI\u2019ll give you a chance. No matter what method you use, think of a way to get my investment back. Otherwise, don\u2019t blame me for being rude to you.\u201d  With that, he left.  In Xilin Imperial Garden.  Lin Xiaowan was watching a movie in the home theater, holding Little Chestnut in her arms. She lay on the couch sideways as she held Little Chestnut and watched the movie.  Due to the smell of the wormwood and disinfectant from the repeated disinfection on the second floor, Little Chestnut was still staying on the first floor.  Perhaps Little Chesnut was still traumatized by her sudden bath a few days ago, it had lost weight even though it was eating well. \n\n At this time, Lin Xiaowan s lit up.  Lin Xiaowan took a look and was puzzled when she saw that it was a message from Lu Yingxin.  [Lu Yingxin: I\u2019m sorry. I really know my mistake. Can we have lunch tomorrow? Hl explain everything to you in Jiyu Courtyard. Please give me another chance. I beg you. After explaining everything, I won\u2019t disturb you anymore. I\u2019ve already been punished because of this. Give me a chance to explain to you. ]  Lu Yingxin\u2019s words seemed sincere, and she seemed remorseful. Lin Xiaowan read the message a few times and could not figure out what Lu Yingxin meant when Lu Yingxin said she had already been punished. In the end, she sighed and replied with one word.  [Lin Xiaowan: Okay.]  \u2018Let\u2019s see what she has to say..\u2019  The next day.  Lin Xiaowan arrived at the meeting place.  Jiyu Courtyard was a small restaurant, and it looked like a farmhouse. There was a big dog there as well. It wagged its tail and stared ar Lin Xiaowan.  When Lin Xiaowan waved her hand, rhe dog ran over ro her and rubbed itself against her happily.  The restaurant was not in a central area, and it was quite remote. Very few people came here for lunch. When the lady boss saw Lin Xiaowan, she came over to greet Lin Xiaowan and asked, \u201cHow many of you are having lunch here? What would you like to eat?\u201d  Lin Xiaowan did not know if Lu Yingxin had arrived. She asked, \u201cDid you a pretty girl? She\u2019s about my age.\u20191  The lady boss did not even need ro think about it. After all, there were nor many people at noon. She replied, \u201cNo. There\u2019s only a table of men drinking.\u201d  However, immediately after that, the lady boss thought of something. She wiped her hands before she went to get a booklet. After taking a look, she asked, \u201cIs your friend\u2019s surname Lu? A lady with the surname Lu made a reservation and said that her friend\u2019s surname is Lin. She told us to bring you in first when you arrive..1\u2018\n6427efcab6463e50e8b1da9c\nIf you want to read more chapters, please visit AllNovelNext.Com to experience faster update speed  \nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

The building was all made of wood. Even the furniture was made of wood.  The private room was upstairs, and a tree stood outside the window. The window was open, allowing the cold breeze to blow in. It was very refreshing and comfortable.  Lin Xiaowan said, filled with praise, \u201cThe location is very good. It\u2019s not hot at all.\u201d  The temperature outside was 30 degrees Celcius. It was hot outside, but it was rather cool in the room.  The lady boss quickly brought the menu over and said with a sigh, \u201cIt\u2019s only cool now. It\u2019ll get hotter later. When winter comes, it\u2019ll be very cold. In winter, we serve chicken and fish hotpot. For now, we have stewed chicken and fish.\u201d  Lin Xiaowan flipped through the menu. Apart from the signature stewed chicken and fish, there were also common and inexpensive stir-fried dishes. After a while, she said, \u201cI\u2019ll wait for my friend to arrive before I order. Sorry to trouble you.\u201d  The lady boss nodded and brought over a glass and a jar of water before she went downstairs.  After a while, Lu Yingxin, who arrived late, came with two cups of milk tea and ice cream in her hands. As soon as she entered the private room, she placed everything on the table before she prostrated herself on the ground in front of Lin Xiaowan.  Lin Xiaowan\u2019s mouth was agape as she looked at Lu Yingxin in shock. She scrambled to her feet and tried to help Lu Yingxin up as she asked, \u201cW-what are you doing?\u201d  \u2018There\u2019s no need to bow so respectfully!\u2019  Lu Yingxin burst into tears. \u201cI know I did something wrong. I\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s true that I don\u2019t live in Xilin Imperial Garden. 1 didn\u2019t care for the first cat well enough, and it fell sick and died. I was afraid that you\u2019d dislike me because of that so I got another cat. I didn\u2019t dare to tell you about it!\u201d \n\n For a moment, Lin Xiaowan did not know what to say. In the end, she said, \u201cGet up first. T-this is not a life-threatening matter. Get up first. Don\u2019t be like this.\u201d Inwardly, Lu Xiaowan thought, \u201cIs she going to die? What\u2019s wrong with her?  Didn\u2019t she deny it vehemently last night? Why did her attitude change so drastically?!\u2019  Lu Yingxin\u2019s knees seemed like they were glued to the ground. Lin Xiaowan tried to pull her up, but she failed.  Lu Yingxin cried and said earnestly, \u201cPlease forgive me. Although 1 lied, I didn\u2019t do anything to harm you! It\u2019s just that I really liked you as soon as I saw you. I only wanted to be friends with you!\u201d  After much persuasion, Lu Yingxin finally got up. After taking a seat, she continued to cry softly before she told Lin Xiaowan some half-truths about why she had lied.  Lin Xiaowan took a sip of the milk tea as she listened. After that, she asked in disbelief, \u201cSo you did all that just to be friends with me? That\u2019s all?\u201d  Lu Yingxin said through her tears, \u201cYes. I don\u2019t know if President Huo misunderstood me. Perhaps that\u2019s why he did that\u2026\u201d  \u201cHuh? Did what?\u201d Lin Xiaowan asked, puzzled.  \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026\u201d Lu Yingxin said, but she was interrupted by her phone ringing. Before answering the call, she said apologetically, \u201cI\u2019m really sorry. I have to take this call. It\u2019s very important.\u201d  Lin Xiaowan nodded in understanding. \u201cOkay.\u201d  Lu Yingxin left the room with her phone. As soon as she left the room, the miserable and pitiful expression on her face vanished completely. In fact, no one called her. She had set an alarm. She turned off the alarm and stood in the hallway for a moment.  Meanwhile, Lin Xiaowan looked at the steamed chicken and two stir-fried dishes on the table that had been served while Lu Yingxin was giving her passionate speech earlier. They were completely untouched, but Lin Xiaowan had already drunk a lot.  Perhaps the temperature was just right, after sitting for a while, Lin Xiaowan began to feel sleepy. Her vision grew more and more blurry. She felt that something was wrong and tried to stand up. She was horrified when she discovered that she had no strength at all. She could not even move, let alone stand up. She tried to call for help but found that she was unable to do so.  A layer of cold sweat appeared on her forehead as she tried to struggle and call for help. However, in just a moment, she could no longer hold on and fell unconscious.  Lu Yingxin waited for about ten minutes in the hallway. When she entered the room and saw Lin Xiaowan lying on the table, a strange smile appeared on her face.  \u2018As long as I can get rid of Lin Xiaowan, I\u2019ll be able to be with Huo Zheng. At that time, 1 won\u2019t have to serve that disgusting old man with a strange fetish anymore!\u2019 \n\n Lu Yingxin was very happy when she imagined how she would be able to torture Old Master Li when she became Mrs. Huo. She would return to him all the harm that he had caused her.  Lu Yingxin had bought some sedatives meant for animals beforehand. Since it could be bought over the counter, she obtained it easily without having to provide any information. However, she did not have any other plans beyond knocking Lin Xiaowan out.  \u2018How do I get rid of her?\u2019  Lu Yingxin sat next to Lin Xiaowan and looked at the latter\u2019s face, which looked tranquil at this moment. Lin Xiaowan\u2019s skin was fair, and when the sunlight shone in, even the fine hair on her face could be seen.  Lu Yingxin felt like she was going to go crazy from jealousy.  At this moment, Lin Xiaowan\u2019s phone, which she had casually placed on the table, rang.  Lu Yingxin took a look and saw that the call was from an unknown number. She casually rejected the call before she pressed the button on the table.  Soon after, the lady boss entered the room and asked if there was anything she could help with.  Lu Yingxin looked very natural as she said with a smile, \u201cI\u2019d like to pay for the bill.\u201d  \u201cThe total is 163 yuan. I\u2019ll give you a discount. You only need to pay 160 yuan,\u201d the lady boss said. When she saw the dishes on the table, she asked, \u201cDo you want to take the food away? The dishes look untouched. Are they not delicious?\u201d  Lu Yingxin feigned a helpless expression on her face as she helped Lin Xiaowan up and said, \u201cIt\u2019s all because of my friend. She hasn\u2019t been sleeping well recently. She just sat down for a while before she fell asleep. The food is delicious. However, it won\u2019t be convenient to bring them with me since 1 have to carry her out. We\u2019ll come again next time.\u201d  \u201cAlright,\u201d the lady boss said, sending them out.  When the lady boss reached out to hold Lin Xiaowan, intending to help carry her, Lu Yingxin was frightened. She was worried that the lady boss would notice that something was wrong so she hurriedly said, \u201cMy friend doesn\u2019t like people touching her. It\u2019s fine. Now that she\u2019s asleep, I don\u2019t want her to wake her up. After all, she hasn\u2019t been sleeping well.\u201d  \u201cOh, 1 see\u2026\u201d  With that, the lady boss no longer tried to help. She followed Lu Yingxin downstairs and stopped near the reception desk. As Lu Yingxin left, she said, \u201cTake care..\u201d\n6427efcab6463e50e8b1da9c\nIf you want to read more chapters, please visit AllNovelNext.Com to experience faster update speed  \nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation  After Lu Yingxin and Lin Xiaowan left, the lady boss went back to work. When she saw her husband, she said, \u201cOne of the young ladies who came earlier was really strange. They didn\u2019t order any alcohol, but she seemed drunk. She even passed out.\u201d  Her husband did not think much of it and only said, \u201cPerhaps she drank before she came.\u201d  It was noon, and the sun was shining brightly. The lady boss was not in a hurry to clear the table since there were not many customers at this time.  In the private room, the phone, which Lu Yingxin had forgotten to bring away, lit up again. A string of unknown numbers called again. After ringing for a while, the phone screen turned dark before it lit up again.  Lu Yingxin did not go far. After leaving the restaurant, she slowly made her way to the back of the restaurant through a very small path. When she walked to the end of the path, she saw a lake.  \u2018As expected\u2026\u2019 Lu Yingxin thought to herself. Earlier, when she was standing in the hallway, she had stood by the window. She could smell a kind of dampness in the air so she guessed that there had to be a lake nearby.  Earlier, Lu Yingxin had drugged Lin Xiaowan\u2019s milk tea. For convenience, she bought milk tea that was not in a sealed cup. Previously, Lin Xiaowan had eaten and drank everything she had given her without any vigilance. As such, she knew that Lin Xiaowan would drink the milk tea she brought without any suspicion.  At this moment, Lu Yingxin was in a good mood. After all, she was about to get rid of an eyesore, someone whom she was intensely jealous of.  Lu Yingxin found a few huge rocks nearby before she stared at Lin Xiaowan\u2019s ankles for a long time. She looked around for suitable tools before she squatted down and looked at Lin Xiaowan\u2019s shoelaces. Lin Xiaowan was wearing a pair of sneakers today. The laces seemed strong and long enough.  Lu Yingxin was not worried that Lin Xiaowan would wake up. After all, she worried that Lin Xiaowan would quickly regain consciousness so she was rather heavy-handed when she drugged the milk tea with sedatives. Fortunately, the milk tea was very sweet so Lin Xiaowan could not taste anything strange with it.  Lu Yingxin tied the heavy rocks to Lin Xiaowan\u2019s ankle using the shoelaces. She was not very skilled so she only tied the rocks to one ankle. She stood up and dusted her hands, thinking that it was enough before she started dragging Lin Xiaowan to the lake. With a splash, she threw Lin Xiaowan into the lake. The surface of the lake rippled, but there was no movement after that.  Apart from the drag marks on the ground, no other traces could be seen. \n\n In a coastal city.  Huo Zheng could not get through to Lin Xiaowan\u2019s phone, and he began to feel uneasy. When he called Aunt Wu and learned that Lin Xiaowan had gone out but had yet to return, he grew even more uneasy.  Lin Xiaowan had never rejected his call before. Moreover, after rejecting his call, she did not answer his subsequent calls. It was too suspicious.  In fact, this was one of Lin Xiaowan\u2019s peculiarities. Her phone\u2019s address book was empty; she did not save anyone\u2019s number. Hence, no matter who called, her phone would only show a string of unknown numbers. Lu Yingxin, who was unaware of this, was very smug when she rejected the call.  Huo Zheng tugged his tie, frustrated, before he massaged his temples.  At this time, Assistant Song knocked on the door and entered. \u201cPresident Huo, Mr. Zhao, the driver, is on the line.\u201d  When Huo Zheng could not get in contact with Lin Xiaowan, he had asked Assistant Song to find out which driver drove Lin Xiaowan out today.  Huo Zheng asked coldly, \u201cIs Young Madam with you?\u201d  The driver straightened his back when he heard Huo Zheng\u2019s voice. He replied, \u201cNo. Young Madam went to eat with someone. The car couldn\u2019t enter the small street so she told me to wait at the entrance. I\u2019m still waiting for her.\u201d  Huo Zheng pinched the bridge of his nose. He could not help but panic; he had an ominous feeling that something had happened. He said, \u201cGo and look for her now. Don\u2019t end the call.\u201d  \u2018Who did she have lunch with?\u2019  Huo Zheng\u2019s mind kept spinning. Aunt Wu did not know whom Lin Xiaowan was having lunch with since Lin Xiaowan did not say anything before she left. However, this was unlike Lin Xiaowan. Lin Xiaowan\u2019s social circle was not big at all. When she went out, she would usually go out with Gu Yuwu. However, if she went out with Gu Yuwu, she would definitely tell Aunt Wu. Not only that, but she would even tell Aunt Wu where she was going.  \u2018Unless she doesn\u2019t feel comfortable about telling Aunt Wu about the person she was having lunch with\u2026\u2019  There was only one person. It was the person whom Aunt Wu had complained about to Lin Xiaowan, someone whom Aunt Wu disliked. It was none other than Lu Yingxin.  Huo Zheng\u2019s sense of unease continued to grow. He hoped that he was overthinking things. \n\n Meanwhile, the driver on the other end of the line could tell from Huo Zheng\u2019s tone that something was wrong. He was very nervous and quickly ran into the restaurant. Since it was the only restaurant around, there was no need for him to look around. When he went to inquire, he felt as though he was going to faint when he heard the answer. He said anxiously, \u201cPresident Huo, the owner said that Young Madam left about ten minutes ago.\u201d  Huo Zheng cursed and smashed the ashtray on the table on the ground, but he quickly forced himself to calm down.  The driver on the other end of the line said, \u201cThere\u2019s only one path leading away from the restaurant. 1 was at the entrance earlier, but I didn\u2019t see Young Madam or any suspicious people come out. The restaurant is called Jiyu Courtyard. I\u2019m going to search the surroundings now.\u201d  Huo Zheng did not end the call. As he wore his Bluetooth earpiece, he said to Assistant Song, \u201cBook the earliest flight back to Shengjing for me. If there\u2019s no flight, get the flight route approved and send the family\u2019s private plane over to pick me up.\u201d  Assistant Song left immediately and got to work.  Huo Zheng\u2019s work here was almost done. Originally, he planned to return to Shengjing tonight. However, now, he did not want to stay a second longer. At this moment, he regretted leaving Lin Xiaowan alone. After all, she was so naive that he needed to take care of her at all times. She would have been fine if he had stayed by her side.  On the other end of the line, the driver said again, \u201cPresident Huo, I found a pair of pink sneakers! They\u2019re size 36. They belong to Young Madam!\u201d  In the next moment, the driver said, panicking, \u201cI think 1 found her!\u201d  Huo Zheng\u2019s heart skipped a beat as he asked, \u201cWhere?\u201d  The driver\u2019s lips moved, but no sound came out. He placed his phone on the ground and quickly dove into the lake, holding his breath.  The driver was not just a driver. He was also skilled in combat so he could protect his employer if necessary. It was only natural that he knew how to swim.  \u201cSpeak!\u201d  Huo Zheng did not receive a reply from the driver and could only hear the sound of water splashing. He felt like he was going to go crazy from anxiety..\n6427efcab6463e50e8b1da9c\nIf you want to read more chapters, please visit AllNovelNext.Com to experience faster update speed  \nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

He kept tapping the table with his fingers anxiously. He was so flustered and panicked that it took a while before he remembered to call his brother who was in Sheng Jing.  Huo Cheng was on his lunch break at this moment. When he received Huo Zheng\u2019s call, he was very relaxed. However, as soon as he heard his younger brother\u2019s panicked and helpless voice, he tensed up. When he realized the gravity of the situation, he said in a deep voice, \u201cCalm down. Tell me the location. 1\u201911 go there now.\u201d  Huo Zheng took a few deep breaths and forced himself to calm down. He said, \u201cThe driver told me he\u2019s at a restaurant called Jiyu Courtyard. 1 don\u2019t know exactly where it is. There\u2019s only one street that leads to it. The driver went to look for her in the area, and then I heard the sound of water splashing. Brother, 1 have a really bad feeling about this\u2026\u201d  Huo Cheng quickly looked up the restaurant on his phone. The restaurant was located in quite a remote area, and it would take at least half an hour for him to arrive. He no longer wasted time and quickly made his way there.  When the secretary-general saw Huo Cheng leaving with his car keys, he quickly said, \u201cMr. Huo, we have a meeting with the military this afternoon. We\u2026\u201d  Huo Cheng did not wait for the other party to finish speaking as he said, \u201cPostpone the meeting. I need to deal with an urgent matter\u2026\u201d  \u201cAll? Alright, I\u2019ll postpone it immediately\u2026\u201d  Huo Cheng drove the car with a special license plate exclusive to members of the cabinet. With this, things were much more convenient. In emergencies, he could bypass traffic lights and the speed limit. No one would pull him over as well.  Meanwhile, Huo Zheng paced around anxiously. He was extremely worried that something had happened to her, and at the same time, he was determined to teach her a lesson about being more vigilant once everything was over.  At this time, the driver finally spoke from the other end of the line. He said, gasping for breath, \u201cP-president Huo, Young Madam is in a bad condition. 1, I\u2026\u201d  Lin Xiaowan was unconscious after being drugged. After she was thrown into the lake, she did not put up a struggle at all and did not hold her breath. As such, she had inhaled a large amount of water. It was critical that she was resuscitated as soon as possible.  When the driver saw her, he did not even dare to go to the surface to catch his breath. He knew that time was of the essence. He quickly swam over and pulled her up. Fortunately, the rocks that were tied to her ankle did not hinder him. It was also because of this that he managed to save her in one go. \n\n However, when the driver brought Lin Xiaowan up, she was not breathing. This was the first time he had faced a life-or-death situation. He was so panicked that he could not even speak properly. He listened for the sounds of heartbeat for a moment before he asked tremblingly, \u201cW-what should I do? 1,1 can\u2019t hear her heartbeat. That\u2019s right, that\u2019s right. 1 should perform CPR!\u201d  Huo Zheng felt as though his heart was going to leap out of his chest when he heard the driver\u2019s words. It was not difficult for him to roughly piece together a picture of what had happened based on this. At the very least, he knew that Lin Xiaowan was drowning earlier. He did not know how long she had been underwater. If it was just for a short moment, it would be easy to save. Otherwise\u2026  The driver was performing CPR at this moment, and he had completely forgotten to call the emergency number first.  Huo Zheng was the one who called the emergency number in the end. In the end, an ambulance was dispatched from the nearest hospital.  One needed strength to perform CPR. After diving into the lake and saving Lin Xiaowan, he quickly performed CPR. He had no time to catch his breath at all. Despite his exhaustion, he continued to work hard until Lin Xiaowan finally spat out a mouthful of water. He quickly turned her sideways and listened for her heartbeat.  \u201cHer heart is beating! It\u2019s beating, but she\u2019s still not breathing.\u201d  At this very moment, Lu Yingxin, who was hiding, watched the entire thing silently. Seeing that Lin Xiaowan was about to be saved, she held her breath and quietly took a few steps back before she quickly ran away with all her might.  It was impossible for a person to run without any sound. However, the driver was only one person after all. He was focused on saving Lin Xiaowan now. Although he heard the sound, it was impossible for him to chase after Lu Yingxin.  Huo Zheng called Huo Cheng again.  \u201cThe ambulance has been dispatched from the Sixth People\u2019s Hospital. It\u2019s the nearest hospital. Brother, you have to help me\u2026\u201d  Huo Cheng stepped on the accelerator again. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019m here, don\u2019t worry.\u201d  When Huo Zheng finally arrived in Shengjing, it was already late at night.  Lin Xiaowan was currently in the intensive care unit, and her condition was not very good.  The driver had already been examined at this time.  Huo Cheng and Qiao You\u2019an were also present, talking in soft voices. \n\n Huo Zheng looked haggard, and his tense expression made him look even colder than usual.  Huo Cheng stood up when he saw his younger brother. He said, \u201cHer lungs aren\u2019t in a good condition. She has pulmonary edema and pneumonia. However, she\u2019s fine for now. The doctor will discuss the details with us after this\u2026\u201d  Huo Zheng did not relax at all. Instead, he asked, \u201cDid you catch the culprit?\u201d  Huo Cheng shook his head. \u201cMy people haven\u2019t found Lu Yingxin\u2026\u201d  After a brief pause, Huo Cheng asked, \u201cAre you sure it\u2019s Lu Yingxin?\u201d  Apart from speaking to the driver, Huo Cheng also sent people to speak to the lady boss of Jiyu Courtyard. Although the person who made the reservation was surnamed Lu and was described to be a beautiful woman, these things were not conclusive evidence.  Huo Zheng nodded. \u201cThere\u2019s no one else but her\u2026\u201d  Huo Zheng looked at the person lying in the intensive care unit before he quickly went to the doctor\u2019s office.  In addition to pneumonia and pulmonary edema, Lin Xiaowan also had acute renal impairment and respiratory failure. Although her vital signs were stable for now, she still had to be kept under observation in case there were other sequelae. In short, the doctor could not guarantee anything for the time being.  Amidst all these things, the sedative that she had been drugged was the most minor.  When the doctor saw Huo Zheng and the others listening attentively and that the expressions of sorrow on their faces were not fake, he could not help but lecture them. \u201cThe patient\u2019s lungs aren\u2019t good, to begin with. Although she has received very good treatment, her lungs can\u2019t afford to suffer repeated blows like that. You have to pay more attention to this\u2026\u201d  Lin Xiaowan lay in the intensive care unit for three days before she finally regained consciousness. She was in a daze when she opened her eyes. Clearly, she did not understand her situation.  Huo Zheng stood by the bedside and held her hands. He choked, unable to speak.  Lin Xiaowan did not have any memories of what happened at all. The last time she remembered was eating at Jiyu Courtyard. However, after a while, she very vaguely remembered being submerged in water. She had very briefly regained consciousness. Her body had gone into survival mode as she inhaled water, but due to the sedative, she quickly fell unconscious again.  When she woke, she was already in the hospital. She had no idea how dangerous the past three days had been..\n6427efcab6463e50e8b1da9c\nIf you want to read more chapters, please visit AllNovelNext.Com to experience faster update speed  \nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

He lowered his head and gently rubbed his chin against Lin Xiaowan\u2019s palm, causing her to laugh from the ticklish sensation. However, as soon as the corners of her lips curled up, she coughed violently. The pain in her lungs and trachea caused her face to scrunch up.  Huo Zheng had been on tenterhook over the past few days. As soon as he heard coughing, he quickly called the doctor over, afraid that something would happen to her.  After regaining consciousness, Lin Xiaowan also had to undergo a few specific tests. After that, she was transferred out of the Sixth People\u2019s Hospital to the All Heart Hospital, where she was previously hospitalized.  At this moment, Lin Xiaowan was sitting up. Qian You\u2019an was feeding her a bowl of nourishing soup and telling her about what had happened. It was only then that she found out that she had nearly died.  \u201cWhere\u2019s Huo Zheng?\u201d  \u201cHe\u2019s speaking to the doctor,\u201d Qiao You\u2019an replied. However, when she thought about how the tall man had to lower his head as he was lectured by the doctor, she could no help but add, amused, \u201cTo be precise, he\u2019s being lectured by the doctor.\u201d  The doctor in All Heart Hospital was the one who treated Lin Xiaowan previously. He was her attending doctor after the incident with Song Zhiyi. Back then, he had carefully reminded Huo Zheng that Lin Xiaowan had to be extra careful due to the lasting damage to her lungs. He had told Huo Zheng that Lin Xiaowan could not afford any more damage to her lungs, and at that time, Huo Zheng had earnestly vowed that he would not let anything happen to Lin Xiaowan. However, in such a short time, Lin Xiaowan was admitted to the hospital because she almost drowned to death. One could only imagine what it did to her lungs. As such, he could not help but reprimand Huo Zheng.  The sequelae of drowning were very obvious. Although Lin Xiaowan was sedentary, her breathing was relatively fast. Her heart rate could go up to 130 bpm even when she was not doing anything strenuous. Apart from that, her cough also did not go away.  Lin Xiaowan stayed in the hospital for three weeks. During that time, Huo Zheng did not leave at all. The living room in her ward had turned into his office. Even when he absolutely had to leave, he would not be away for more than two hours. Not only that, but during the time he was away, he would constantly call her.  Currently, Lin Xiaowan still had to undergo a few more checkups. If there were no major problems, she could be discharged and go home.  At this time, Lin Xiaowan noticed that Huo Zheng was not in a good mood after answering a call. She asked curiously, \u201cWho called?\u201d  Huo Zheng went over to hold her hand and kissed it before he said, \u201cIt\u2019s Gu Yuwu\u2019s husband. Lu Yingxin hasn\u2019t been caught yet. He called today to discuss something with me.\u201d  Lin Xiaowan asked, confused, \u201cWhy did Lu Yingxin do this?\u201d  Huo Zheng shook his head. What was Lu Yingxin thinking? No conclusive motives were found after the investigation. However, while Lin Xiaowan was hospitalized, he had a lot of time to think and came out with a few guesses. He said, \u201cLu Yingxin bribed the security guards in Xilin Imperial Garden. Her reasons for befriending you are unknown, but they\u2019re definitely not pure\u2026\u201d \n\n Lin Xiaowan had told Huo Zheng about what Lu Yingxin said when they were in Jiyu Courtyard. Needless to say, Huo Zheng did not believe Lu Yingxin at all.  \u201cPresident Li isn\u2019t her boyfriend. The two of them are in a\u2026 transactional relationship. Perhaps she\u2019s jealous of us\u2026\u201d Huo Zheng said.  \u201cTransactional relationship?\u201d  Lin Xiaowan still had another two more checkups so Huo Zheng said, \u201cI\u2019ll tell you after your checkup\u2026\u201d  At this time, Huo Zheng had already brought her to the consultation room.  After the checkups were completed, Lin Xiaowan returned to her ward. She was still thinking about Huo Zheng\u2019s earlier words.  At this time, many of Huo Zheng\u2019s employees were in the living room of the ward, reporting their work to him. He even had an online meeting later in the afternoon.  There was nothing for her to do in the hospital. Her movements were greatly restricted now so she spent a lot of time drawing and painting. As such, her account on Speaker was updated quite regularly with various watercolor landscape paintings.  Lunch was prepared by the chef in the ward. Lin Xiaowan\u2019s ward was indeed luxurious. It was not much different from a small single-person apartment. It naturally came with a kitchen of its own.  While Huo Zheng was busy with his meeting, Lin Xiaowan stayed in the kitchen with the chef. Many of the ingredients had already been prepped before they were brought over so the chef only needed to cook them. Seeing Lin Xiaowan tailing him, the chef gave her a pear and told her to sit on a small stool to peel the pear.  As usual, Lin Xiaowan told the chef what she wanted to eat. As she peeled the pear, she said, \u201cI want to drink pear smoothie today\u2026\u201d  The weather had been getting hotter and hotter recently. Afraid that she would catch a cold, Huo Zheng did not turn on the air conditioner and only left the fan on. Although it was not too hot, Lin Xiaowan still craved something cold.  Lin Xiaowan continued to say in a low voice, \u201c1 haven\u2019t had cupcakes in a while\u2026\u201d  The chef turned down the fire on the stove to slowly simmer the food in the pot. Then, he said, \u201cYoung Madam, I\u2019m afraid you can\u2019t eat whatever you want for the time being.\u201d  All of Lin Xiaowan\u2019s food was now cooked based on the list that the nutritionist at the hospital had given them. What she ate every day was clearly listed. Let alone smoothies and cupcakes, even sweet potatoes were deemed too sweet for her.  Lin Xiaowan pouted and asked, \u201cI should be able to eat pears, right?\u201d  \u2018Pears can nourish the lungs and stop coughing\u2026 It should be fine, right?\u2019 \n\n The chef took the small pear she peeled and sliced it into pieces before placing them on a small plate. After placing a small fork on it, he said, \u201cYes, but the amount is restricted\u2026\u201d  Huo Zheng ended the meeting for lunch and ate with Lin Xiaowan.  At this time, Lin Xiaowan could no longer suppress her curiosity. She asked, \u201cCan you tell me now? What kind of transactional business is it?\u201d  Huo Zheng tapped her plate and said, \u201cEat first.\u201d  Seeing that she was eating, he continued to say, \u201cLu Yingxin participated in a variety show, and she met President Li because of the show. He\u2019s not dating her. He\u2019s\u2026\u201d  Huo Zheng paused, trying to find the right words to make it less explicit.  Lin Xiaowan asked tentatively, \u201cIs he her sugar daddy?\u201d  \u201cThat\u2019s right\u2026\u201d Huo Zheng said with a nod. Then, he asked, slightly unhappy, \u201cDo you know what a sugar daddy is?\u201d  Lin Xiaowan nodded. \u201cI know! I read a lot of news in the entertainment industry. There were many stories about how sugar daddies became true loves and such. The stories were all very dramatic\u2026\u201d  \u201cWhat kind of things have you been reading?\u201d Huo Zheng asked, feeling speechless.  \u201cAnyway, that\u2019s not important! Tell me about Lu Yingxin and her sugar daddy. Why did she do this?\u201d Lin Xiaowan urged.  Huo Zheng sighed helplessly. \u201cFinish the soup in your bowl. It\u2019s getting cold.\u201d  Then, he said, \u201cLu Yingxin is no different from an object to President Li. Moreover, he doesn\u2019t have a good temper. He often beats and scolds Lu Yingxin.\u201d  Huo Zheng did not tell Lin Xiaowan that Old Master Li also liked to humiliate Lu Yingxin in the bedroom.  Although Old Master Li did not take Lu Yingxin seriously, he still had a relationship with Lu Yingxin after all. As such, after she committed this crime, he was attacked by the Huo family. Unable to find Lu Yingxin, Huo Zheng vented all his anger on Old Master Li.  When Old Master Li heard about what Lu Yingxin had done, he was so frightened that he told Huo Zheng everything about Lu Yingxin from the beginning until the end..\n6427efcab6463e50e8b1da9c\nIf you want to read more chapters, please visit AllNovelNext.Com to experience faster update speed  \nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation  \u201cLu Yingxin is probably jealous of our relationship so she did those things,\u201d Huo Zheng said. He did not tell Lin Xiaowan that Old Master Li emphasized that Lu Yingxin deliberately tried to get close to Lin Xiaowan because Lu Yingxin wanted to seduce Huo Zheng.  Lin Xiaowan nodded, looking a little down. \u201cI see. So that\u2019s how it is\u2026\u201d  After a moment, she asked again, \u201cSo there\u2019s no trace of Lu Yingxin at all since then?\u201d  Huo Zheng fed Lin Xiaowan a small mouthful of vegetables before he said, \u201cNo. We\u2019ve checked the airports, train stations, bus stations, banks, and hotels, but there\u2019s no trace of her at all\u2026\u201d  Naturally, there were ways to get around undetected. Lu Yingxin could have hired an unlicensed car. There were also buses which could be paid for in cash. In any case, it was hard to say if she had left Shengjing.  Apart from that, apart from the kitchen and the counter, there were no other surveillance cameras in Jiyu Courtyard.  After looking through the footage from the surveillance cameras on the streets, they only saw her appearing once for a few minutes before she disappeared again. There were at least thousands of surveillance cameras in Shengjing. It was impossible to look through all the footage.  On the day Lu Yingxin met Lin Xiaowan for lunch, she withdrew 50,000 yuan in the morning. In Huo Zheng\u2019s opinion, as soon as the money was used up, Lu Yingxin would have to go to the bank again. In short, he would be able to find her eventually.  Lin Xiaowan recalled that Lu Yingxin had a role in Gu Yuwu\u2019s movie. Although it was not an important role, she still had a lot of scenes. She asked, \u201cThen will this matter affect the release of the movie?\u201d  Huo Zheng was not familiar with matters regarding the entertainment industry so he said, \u201cYou\u2019ll have to ask Gu Yuwu about this.\u201d \n\n Gu Yuwu had visited Lin Xiaowan twice. The first time she visited, Lin Xiaowan had just regained consciousness and was still in the Sixth People\u2019s Hospital. She was understandably furious and kept cursing Lu Yingxin.  After two days, Lin Xiaowan was finally discharged from the hospital. The doctor prescribed medicine for her pulmonary circulation and respiratory system before she left, and she had to take them twice a day. Fortunately, they were in the form of pills so she was not averse to taking them.  On the first day she returned home, Lin Xiaowan lost her temper at Huo Zheng. That was because Huo Zheng mentioned that he wanted to give Little Chestnut away. She looked at Huo Zheng with eyes widened in disbelief as she asked, \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d  The second floor had been thoroughly cleaned, and it became Little Chestnut\u2019s territory again. With this, it had a wider range of movements.  Lin Xiaowan had not seen Little Chestnut for almost a month. As soon as she reached home, she kicked off her shoes and wanted to go upstairs to see Little Chestnut. However, before she could do so, Huo Zheng stopped her. After that, he said those incendiary words.  Lin Xiaowan\u2019s breathing rate was already rapid, to begin with. Now that she was stimulated, she began to cough and have trouble breathing. Not only that, but her heart rate shot up as well.  Huo Zheng naturally did not dare to make her angry. He quickly held her in his arms and stroked her back as he said, \u201cQingqing, calm down. Listen to me first, okay?\u201d  Lin Xiaowan pushed him away and shouted, \u201c1 don\u2019t want to listen to you!\u201d  Huo Zheng remained patient and continued to coax her. \u201cOkay, okay. Speak softly, okay? Otherwise, you\u2019ll hurt your throat. Just give me a chance, and listen to me, okay?\u201d  Lin Xiaowan was furious. She turned her head away and ignored him. She knew that Huo Zheng was never enthusiastic about Little Chestnut. He was indifferent to both cats and dogs. However, she had raised Little Chestnut for quite a while now, and she could not accept the fact that he suggested giving Little Chestnut away. She felt that he did not respect her and that he was unreasonable.  Huo Zheng pulled her into his arms and kissed her forehead gently. Then, he tried to reason with her, saying, \u201cI\u2019ve spoken to the doctor. With your current condition, raising will increase the burden on your lungs and trachea. If Little Chestnut\u2019s hair enters your lungs, it\u2019s very easy for your lungs to get an infection due to the bacteria the hair might carry\u2026\u201d  Little Chestnut had long fur, after all. It was constantly shedding. Whenever it moved, fur would flutter in the air. Moreover, this was after Lin Xiaowan\u2019s regular and careful grooming.  Lin Xiaowan was very resistant to the suggestion. She said emotionally, \u201cLittle Chestnut is very clean! She doesn\u2019t have any bacteria!\u201d \n\n Huo Zheng tried to think of another solution. He said, \u201c1 can\u2019t bear to give Little Chestnut away as well, but we don\u2019t have a choice. Why don\u2019t we get another cat? We can get a hairless cat, a Sphynx?\u201d  Lin Xiaowan\u2019s eyes reddened when she heard him casually talking about getting another cat. She tried to hold back her tears, but it was useless. It did not take long before tears streamed down her face.  Huo Zheng quickly wiped her tears away, feeling his heart ache. He said helplessly, \u201cI was wrong, 1 was wrong. Don\u2019t cry, okay? It\u2019s all my fault.\u201d  Lin Xiaowan took a deep breath. Tears continued to stream down her face as she said stutteringly, \u201cH-how can you replace Little Chestnut casually? I want Little Chestnut!\u201d  Lin Xiaowan grew sadder and sadder as she spoke. At this time, it was no longer purely about Little Chestnut. She was reminded of the puppy she once had.  At that time, she had just moved out of her grandmother\u2019s house, and the condition of the house she rented was not very good. There was no heating during winter, and the air conditioner was broken so they could not be used in summer. The winter in her hometown was bitter and cold. She had covered herself with two blankets, but they were not enough to keep her warm. She endured until late winter before she brought the puppy with her back to her grandmother\u2019s house. She thought that she would stay for two months and leave once the weather was no longer so cold.  Her grandmother hated the dog very much. She constantly referred to it as \u2018little bastard\u2019. In fact, Lin Xiaowan felt that she perhaps her grandmother was also calling her \u2018little bast*rd\u2019. Apart from that, she was forced to keep the dog in a very small cage when she went to classes. It barely had enough space to stand up and turn around.  Her grandmother had also fed the dog with wild vegetables and dirty water when she was away. She only found out about this when she came home from classes early one day.  In the end, only two weeks had passed when she received a message from her father saying that he had given the dog away. She still remembered it clearly. At that time, it was 7.30 PM. She had just bought some vegetables and a four-inch chocolate cake from the supermarket. It was her birthday. It was also at that time that she received her father\u2019s message.  The more Lin Xiaowan thought about it, the sadder she became. She could not help but worry that Huo Zheng would secretly give Little Chestnut away when she was not home and that she would come home to an empty second floor.  Lin Xiaowan cried very hard. Her face turned red, and she struggled to breathe. Her heart was also beating rapidly in her chest.  Huo Zheng was completely flustered. He hugged and kissed her, trying to calm her down and coax her. He said gently, \u201cI was wrong, 1 was wrong. Baby, don\u2019t cry, okay? We won\u2019t give Little Chestnut away.\u201d  He felt like his heart was going to break from her tears..\n6427efcab6463e50e8b1da9c\nIf you want to read more chapters, please visit AllNovelNext.Com to experience faster update speed  \nVisit and read more novel to help us update chapter quickly.
